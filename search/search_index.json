Davis III / @csggene3 The last two years have seen a precipitous rise and fall in the both the price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum amongst many new others branded as ICOs (or initial coin offerings) as well as a general awareness of their existence and the broader underlying ecosystems that accompany them. Many this year are quite upset with their purchases from last year due to the steep drop off in associated prices. The perception is that software developers created simple tokens on the various issuing blockchains (like Ethereum, NEO, Cardano, Ethereum Classic, etc) that served little more purpose than to act as a form of quick and dirty security issuance, or \"penny stock,\" with little oversight or regulation, and then cashed out large groups of shares for themselves, ostensibly to fund future software development of their projects, but truthfully or more likely to enrich themselves greatly with no intention or obligation for their promises to the public or their own investors to be kept. There are hundreds of similar projects like these with similar accusations against their progenitors and \"developers,\" or dismissed as \" honest failures due to diminished market conditions,\" yet these types of blatant excuses fall on the deaf ears of the thousands that lost out and the many other honest developers that knew better.

Recent News We are proud to announce the start of P2P Models Introducing aragonOS 3.0 alpha Launch of Aragon Nest DAOs Aragon Aragon Author unknown on Jan 31 Author Jorge Izquierdo on Jan 25 Author Tatu K\u00e4rki on Jan 24 P2P Models is a \u20ac1.5M 5-year ERC research project to build decentralized, democratic, and sustainable Collaborative Economy organizations. The Collaborative Economy is rapidly expanding, but it is dominated by centralized web platforms which hold user data and concentrate all decision-making power and profits. The idea of the P2P Models project is to tackle these issues, replacing the centralized web platform with DAOs on the blockchain, so we reduce the difference of power between the \"infrastructure owner\" and the user community. The new operating system for protocols and DApps. aragonOS is smart contract development framework with a very strong focus on governance and upgradeability. This architecture can be used by any complex DApp or protocol and it allows extendability with the ability to plug in any Aragon governance module. It was originally designed to build modular DAOs, but we ended up abstracting it more and more to the point where it would be useful as the fundamental building block of any decentralized project. Grants program is open for submissions. At the end of 2017 we presented Aragon Nest to the community and encouraged people to start coming up with ideas for the launch.In that blog post, Introducing Aragon Nest, we outlined the reasons and goals of the program.Now the time has come to launch the program.

The community has asked for a simple breakdown of the district0x network and the following post is based on this community feedback. Let\u2019s dive in\u2026 Our Vision Everything we\u2019re building is to challenge the current ownership structures of our world\u2019s communities and marketplaces. We work together everyday to lower the bar of entry so anyone can do this as well. We believe there is a better world within grasp and we value the visions of the people that think differently about our future. With each new partnership and community member we\u2019re building a network effect that will move us forward to these shared goals. How Will We Achieve This? With each development, we\u2019re progressively building what we call d0xINFRA, a standard framework that will power the underlying network. We\u2019re building d0xINFRA by utilizing already established curation market models like a \u2018 Token Curated Registry \u2019 within our District Registry , utilizing distributed marketplace concepts ( Uber , Upwork , and Airb b ) and allowing for open modular governance models by using Aragon . Each district we launch will be a core component of d0xINFRA: Ethlance - Search, filtering, posting, listing, ranking and reputation Name Bazaar - Core framework/contracts for the d0xINFRA network Meme Factory - Curation functions, community functions, will be one of the first district registries, and will decentralize a crypto-collectible model that currently operates successfully with centralized parties. The Staking Interface After the Aragon mainnet launch, we will deploy a staking interface that allows DNT holders to participate in open control over the districts through an Aragon governance layer for each of the markets that come online. When a district is created, an Aragon entity will also be created that people can interact with through the staking mechanism. After staking you will receive voting rights in that district. What is the District Creation Interface? The creation interface can be described as the WordPress of dApps, the districts we\u2019re launching are like wordpress templates, while auxiliary modules can be seen as WordPress plugins to extend functionality. This will all come together after the core d0xINFRA framework is online. This will dramatically lower the bar of entry for anyone wanting to remove central power structures from any marketplace they can dream up, even if they aren\u2019t a developer. Governance Aragon will be utilized as a governance layer and enable the ability to stake DNT to districts. It will also allow us to start building out district-specific governance functions. People will stake DNT in those varying governance models. Some governance models that we will likely see: Time based staking Stake weighted Meritocracy and reputation hybrids Futarchy Liquid democracy or delegate style governance When you stake DNT to a district you will be granted access to the Aragon entity\u2019s voting rights. Considering the modular nature of Aragon, the benefit of staking will be different depending on the individual district. Examples of things that governance participants could potentially control: Monetization District design Governance structure Bylaws Auxiliary modules utilized Utilization of fees and development funding Reputation systems Development roadmaps Conclusion The end result will be a world where you can create a market that suits your needs, where market participants have the say as much as anyone else and no central power structure can dictate how the market works. We want anyone in the world to have access to the benefits that decentralization brings. The district0x network is yours and we can\u2019t wait to see what you build.

Hardware, Software, and Data are commoditized by decentralization The process of commoditization turns a good or service which is highly differentiated or even unique into a fungible resource, where differences between the commodity offered by sellers in a market are low. Commoditized markets are associated with declining prices and narrow profit margins, as competitors struggle to differentiate their offerings and instead rely on price-based competition. Hardware : Ethereum lets you pay for computation and storage on an as-needed basis by paying gas. Projects like Golem , Storj , Truebit , and others aim to further commoditize hardware through decentralized networks. Products that build on these technologies cannot rely on specialized hardware as a key differentiator. Software : Open source software is commoditized, there is no difference between one instance of public code versus another instance of the same code. Since the only applications that make sense to run on a blockchain are those that benefit from trust-minimization, public source code is the standard. Data : Decentralized applications rely on publicly available data sources, otherwise there is no way for the public to validate transactions. Privacy technology such as zk-Snarks may obscure public visibility, but the encrypted dataset that enables a shared state remains public. Products or services offered in a market like this will either compete on price, quickly driving profit margins down or seek out new ways to differentiate themselves. One way to differentiate is to issue a token , even if you don\u2019t otherwise need one. Having a token allows you to create a network effect around your product, people who hold this token will have a vested interest and prefer your product over alternatives. They will be your biggest advocates, they will shill your product to all their friends, who will jump on the band wagon, and do the same to their friends\u2026 and on and on. Or maybe not\u2026 If the market is commoditized and your competitors have at best an equivalent product to yours, issuing a token and requiring it to be used in order to access your product works (sort of like an API key ). However, by forcing the use of a token when your application doesn\u2019t require one you create a worse user experience because the user\u2019s effective cost is unpredictable. Now if a competitor offers the same product without the restriction, it isn\u2019t equivalent, it is objectively better. Therefore, differentiation in this way may work to some degree, but is not particularly defensible. Defensible tokenization In a defensible token model you cannot remove the token or replace it with a different token and create a better user experience. To help reason about the defensibility of different tokenization models, identifying a baseline that all defensible token models have in common is helpful: A : Fees are justified for services provided . The execution of arbitrary smart-contract code does not justify paying fees in excess of the gas used to validate/mine transactions. B : It is not defensible to force the usage of a token in such a way that the application would work equally well or better using a different token . (e.g. a stable coin, or ETH) C : Tokens which are uniquely required to incentivize or disincentivize behavior in order to provide a service accrue value relative to that services utility. If we agree on these statements we can immediately throw out many tokenization strategies. For example a token whose primary utility is to be the exclusive medium of exchange for transactions within a network violates all three of these statements. [A] because having to convert to the native token is an arbitrary fee unrelated to a service. [B] because in a market that requires a medium of exchange, a stable token that everyone already has works far better than the application\u2019s native token. [C] because the token is not inherently linked to the incentivization of agents performing a service. We can also look at some models which do not violate any of these statements. Proof of Work, Proof of Stake , decentralized oracles , Token Curated Registries . Each instance of these mechanisms requires its own unique token to make the crypto-economic incentives align between multiple parties. Defensible tokenization exists at the blockchain protocol level (Proof of Work, Proof of Stake) and at the blockchain application layer (decentralized oracles, Token Curated Registries). The key difference is not whether the product is a protocol or an application, but whether the network effect driven by tokenization is defensible or not. However, having a defensible token model is not sufficient to maintain a strong network effect . Token balances can be copied by competitors, software and datasets can be forked, how do you ensure that your token holders are loyal and will continue to prefer your service over that of competitors? Loyalty is everything Networks are anti-rival with network effects that push towards monopolistic competition , but commoditization driven by decentralization pushes the market towards perfect competition . Decentralized networks will either be wildly successful, or have minimal value, and the biggest factor is how well the network is able to nurture its network effect. We can understand this effect from the perspective of an individual participant using Albert Hirchman\u2019s theory of Exit, Voice, and Loyalty . The theory says that an individual who perceives a decline in the benefit of remaining within a group may respond by Exit, leaving the group , or Voice, by proposing changes that would increase their benefit . In the context of networks built on blockchains the individual may exit by either selling their tokens, or by forking and creating a competitive product. Someone who is considering quitting Facebook not only has to quit they have to start a new service from scratch without any user accounts or data. Blockchain networks are different, a fork can replicate not just the applications software, but also the state. Now the user can quit and move over to a perfect alternative, and they can more easily convince their friends to switch as well, there is significantly less friction for exit in the context of blockchain-based networks . That\u2019s not to say that there is no friction when exiting, network effects have inertia and most participants prefer to stay on whichever network the majority of their peers support. However, if we acknowledge that the biggest barrier to a fork is the desire to maintain a network effect, than we come to the conclusion that we must maximize Voice of network participants. The best way to maximize voice is through effective governance. The Governance Imperative Governance processes may be formal or informal, on-chain or off-chain, the exact details are less important so long as the process is effective and legitimate enough to maintain loyalty and attract more new network constituents over time. Union Square Ventures pointed to governance as the new basis for competion nearly ten years ago. Fred Ehrsam\u2019s recent post on governance suggests that blockchain networks will result in a Cambrian explosion of governance processes. In a tokenized ecosystem that enables rapid experimentation with governance processes, improving our governance processes is imperative. Anything that relies on a governance process today must be willing and able to rapidly adopt new processes or risk being left behind by the competition. The processes that are \u201ceffective and legitimate\u201d enough today may not be as soon as it becomes common knowledge that a better alternative exists. In some cases our existing structures are complex, emergent, and not well documented and as Vlad Zamfir\u2019s recent post against moving to on-chain governance for Ethereum points out replacing something you don\u2019t fully understand with something you do is not necessarily wise. In other cases we are confident our current processes are problematic and need to be replaced as quickly as possible. DApp developers face the challenge of writing applications that need to be future-proof despite being deployed in an environment still under development. They must decide between immutability and upgradeability. Despite their best efforts bugs may be found in production, and it would be good if fixes could be applied quickly. Even if they choose to write immutable contracts, if users typically access their contracts through a DNS and ENS pointer, then a governance process is needed to manage that change. For a product to be decentralized, it must be impossible for a single individual or small team to unilaterally make changes. Current approaches to govern smart-contract upgradeability such as using a multi-sig are highly centralized. Whereas adopting tokenized governance transfers the authority of changes that impact the community to the community itself. DApp developers will likely be the earliest and most successful adopters of tokenized governance models. At first this may simply be a way to securely update smart contracts , but it should expand to more abstract decisions that attract and maintain a community\u2019s network effect both at the application and at the protocol layer. Governance as a Service (GaaS) Governance as a Service (GaaS) is a tokenization model where the primary utility of a token is governance over the protocol, application, or network. Token holders are the only party whose interest we can programmatically quantify. Other relevant parties exist, including users, developers, miners, and validators, but their interests in the network are not programatically quantifiable. By entrusting decisions which impact the network to token holders, they become the keepers of the network effect. The service they are providing is formal representation of the informal interests of all network participants. The model is defensible because [A] fees can be justified for the service token holders provide (making decisions that ensure the long term sustainability and growth of the network). If token holders do a bad job, or charge excessive fees, the network will fail, but if they do a good job they will be able to adapt to changing market conditions and be more resilient to the effects of commoditization. [B] Properties like stability are not critical to participating in governance. [C] Using a unique token is required because it quantifies a users influence in order to align incentivizes to ensure the service provided is consistent. The value of a governance token accrues relative to the importance of the decisions being made. The more people that use the product and rely on its functionality, the more important critical decisions become, the more value will flow to the governance token. Conclusion If you\u2019re building a product that relies on a network effect, creating a governance token or adding governance privileges to your existing token can be incredibly powerful. It increases voice for participants and makes the network effects more resilient. There are many promising approaches to token based governance including quadratic voting , liquid democracy , futarchy , and many forms of meritocracy that warrant attention. Each process has different strengths and weaknesses, some which are obvious and others which may require experimental implementations to uncover. It\u2019s unclear what the ideal governance mechanism is, or if there is even an effective one-size-fits all mechanism. It is clear, however, that finding better mechanisms is extremely valuable . At Aragon we are building infrastructure to support these experiments. aragonOS allows for governance applications to be built and shared between organizations, and privileges can be set such that more experimental models can be tried in limited capacities at first and gradually given more authority. This will enable us to bring continuous improvement processes from the software world into the realm of economics and social sciences, while maintaining acceptable levels of risk.

The best way to maximize voice is through effective governance.","title":"Loyalty is everything"},{"location":"archive/issue01/articles/opinion/thoughts_on_governance_network_effects/#the-governance-imperative","text":"Governance processes may be formal or informal, on-chain or off-chain, the exact details are less important so long as the process is effective and legitimate enough to maintain loyalty and attract more new network constituents over time. Union Square Ventures pointed to governance as the new basis for competion nearly ten years ago. Fred Ehrsam\u2019s recent post on governance suggests that blockchain networks will result in a Cambrian explosion of governance processes. In a tokenized ecosystem that enables rapid experimentation with governance processes, improving our governance processes is imperative. Anything that relies on a governance process today must be willing and able to rapidly adopt new processes or risk being left behind by the competition. The processes that are \u201ceffective and legitimate\u201d enough today may not be as soon as it becomes common knowledge that a better alternative exists. In some cases our existing structures are complex, emergent, and not well documented and as Vlad Zamfir\u2019s recent post against moving to on-chain governance for Ethereum points out replacing something you don\u2019t fully understand with something you do is not necessarily wise. In other cases we are confident our current processes are problematic and need to be replaced as quickly as possible. DApp developers face the challenge of writing applications that need to be future-proof despite being deployed in an environment still under development. They must decide between immutability and upgradeability. Despite their best efforts bugs may be found in production, and it would be good if fixes could be applied quickly. Even if they choose to write immutable contracts, if users typically access their contracts through a DNS and ENS pointer, then a governance process is needed to manage that change. For a product to be decentralized, it must be impossible for a single individual or small team to unilaterally make changes. Current approaches to govern smart-contract upgradeability such as using a multi-sig are highly centralized. Whereas adopting tokenized governance transfers the authority of changes that impact the community to the community itself. DApp developers will likely be the earliest and most successful adopters of tokenized governance models. At first this may simply be a way to securely update smart contracts , but it should expand to more abstract decisions that attract and maintain a community\u2019s network effect both at the application and at the protocol layer.","title":"The Governance Imperative"},{"location":"archive/issue01/articles/opinion/thoughts_on_governance_network_effects/#governance-as-a-service-gaas","text":"Governance as a Service (GaaS) is a tokenization model where the primary utility of a token is governance over the protocol, application, or network. Token holders are the only party whose interest we can programmatically quantify. Other relevant parties exist, including users, developers, miners, and validators, but their interests in the network are not programatically quantifiable. By entrusting decisions which impact the network to token holders, they become the keepers of the network effect. The service they are providing is formal representation of the informal interests of all network participants. The model is defensible because [A] fees can be justified for the service token holders provide (making decisions that ensure the long term sustainability and growth of the network). If token holders do a bad job, or charge excessive fees, the network will fail, but if they do a good job they will be able to adapt to changing market conditions and be more resilient to the effects of commoditization. [B] Properties like stability are not critical to participating in governance. [C] Using a unique token is required because it quantifies a users influence in order to align incentivizes to ensure the service provided is consistent. The value of a governance token accrues relative to the importance of the decisions being made. The more people that use the product and rely on its functionality, the more important critical decisions become, the more value will flow to the governance token.","title":"Governance as a Service (GaaS)"},{"location":"archive/issue01/articles/opinion/thoughts_on_governance_network_effects/#conclusion","text":"If you\u2019re building a product that relies on a network effect, creating a governance token or adding governance privileges to your existing token can be incredibly powerful. It increases voice for participants and makes the network effects more resilient. There are many promising approaches to token based governance including quadratic voting , liquid democracy , futarchy , and many forms of meritocracy that warrant attention. Each process has different strengths and weaknesses, some which are obvious and others which may require experimental implementations to uncover. It\u2019s unclear what the ideal governance mechanism is, or if there is even an effective one-size-fits all mechanism. It is clear, however, that finding better mechanisms is extremely valuable . At Aragon we are building infrastructure to support these experiments. aragonOS allows for governance applications to be built and shared between organizations, and privileges can be set such that more experimental models can be tried in limited capacities at first and gradually given more authority. This will enable us to bring continuous improvement processes from the software world into the realm of economics and social sciences, while maintaining acceptable levels of risk.","title":"Conclusion"},{"location":"archive/issue01/articles/opinion/thoughts_on_governance_network_effects/#to-keep-up-with-the-progress-of-aragon","text":"Come chat with us at the Aragon Chat Follow Aragon on Twitter Subscribe to the Aragon subreddit Follow Aragon at LinkedIn Contribute to Aragon at GitHub Find us on Youtube Explore the Aragon Wiki","title":"To keep up with the progress of\u00a0Aragon:"},{"location":"archive/issue01/classifieds/","text":"Classifieds Classifieds or Classified advertising is free of charge in the newspaper.

This architecture can be used by any complex DApp or protocol and it allows extendability with the ability to plug in any Aragon governance module. It was originally designed to build modular DAOs, but we ended up abstracting it more and more to the point where it would be useful as the fundamental building block of any decentralized project. P2P Models is a \u20ac1.5M 5-year ERC research project to build decentralized, democratic, and sustainable Collaborative Economy organizations. The Collaborative Economy is rapidly expanding, but it is dominated by centralized web platforms which hold user data and concentrate all decision-making power and profits.

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations aka DAOs have for too long been a taboo few dared to speak out loud. The catastrophic failure of The DAO ensured that the topic of decentralized organizations was pushed into oblivion.

Blockchain hype is at an all-time high and many people anticipate the first decentralized application to reach the market and gain mass adoption. The term DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) is no longer esoteric. And hundreds of like-minded teams are building decentralized collaborative social news, insurance and investment platforms, numerous collaboration spaces, and even a couple of decentralized autonomous space agencies.

It facilitates the transfer of its cryptocurrency, can support decentralised applications, and runs smart contracts. Smart contracts run on its blockchain and are the building blocks for ambitious projects, including games like CryptoKitties. To see what lies ahead for Ethereum, MyBroadband spoke to Ethereum developer Nick Johnson about the implications of decentralised organisations. Since the \u201chack\u201d of The DAO, this organizational structure has not been much used, I believe partially because of the reputational damage it caused, and partially due to its intrinsic complexity, especially for those who are not familiar with decentralized governance and/or blockchain. Nevertheless, if 2017 has been the year for ICOs, 2018 may be the year for the DAO return. What are Bonding Curves? This is a technical primer on how to make your own bonding curves, followed by a discussion about the opportunities and risks involved. If you\u2019re not interested in the tech, skip to the end for some general insights.

Ever since the early days of the Aragon project we\u2019ve known that there will be obstacles that we\u2019ll need to solve. Concepts that exist, but require research before we can begin implementing these ideas. But there\u2019s no single solution in governance that works for each and every one.

The goal of Aragon Labs is to enable experimental research and development efforts that move fast and some times break (minor) things. This post is a continuation of part 1, which provided an introduction to blockchain race conditions, front-running, the 0x protocol specification and presented two ways that 0x protocol may be used to implement a decentralized exchange that eliminates front-running and trade collisions by setting the 0x order schema\u2019s taker parameter to an externally owned account (EOA).

More specifically, the team aims to build an infrastructure which lets anyone create value without borders or intermediaries. Additionally, they hope to democratize governance in the future, although that will not be easy. Decentralized organizations are an appealing business model, but making sure they work in the real world is something else entirely. Splitting the Foundation from the core devs, and kickstarting funding for other teams to work on Aragon. In the tech world, startups usually capitalize by amassing Intellectual Property, data, and governance. They attempt to centralize all this to their own benefit. Most crypto projects that are pursuing decentralization can\u2019t be categorized as startups. Crypto projects usually capitalize by creating a network/protocol/DApp that has a token which should become more valuable as the utility of its network/protocol/DApp grows. To encourage other teams to work on Aragon, we will be splitting off the Foundation to form a company of core developers. Premises, Promises, and Reality. There is a massive divide between the promises of cryptocurrency and the use cases they currently support. Most skeptics point out reasonably that there\u2019s little to show regarding real adoption. At the same time, people in industry argue that they need time to finish the infrastructure before they can deliver game changing apps. And the tribalism clouding the topic doesn\u2019t help. There is room for dialogue that would benefit both sides.

Governance Governance Ecosystem Author Conspiratus on Feb 14 Author Don Gossen on Feb 20 Author Simon de la Rouviere on Feb 20 Our first full Conspiratus episode where we discuss protocol governance with our two guests, Vlad Zamfir and Arthur Breitman. Check out the associated reading list for this episode here Today it is with great excitement that the Ocean Protocol team announces the release of the Ocean Protocol Technical Whitepaper! Ocean Protocol is a labor of love, blood, sweat, and tears. It encompasses the cumulative knowledge of multiple teams across multiple domains across multiple regions. It is a schelling point, influenced by tangible proficiency in diverse areas of expertise including data ecosystem architecture, blockchain implementation, cryptographic design, token mechanics, marketplace dynamics, game theory, and scalable, best-of-breed solution delivery. It is a framework that brings together services and capabilities to unlock data for AI. Without regulation, it is hard to avoid the abuse of a commons: whether it is water, a pasture or a forest. Even with regulation from governments there are still externalities that exist that are tough to enforce: eg, global regulation is hard, some commons are out of reach of regulation, some commons regulation could still be abused through corruption some externalities are simply never catered for due to the cost in coordination. Instead of trying to force actors to curb the inevitable abuse of a commons, one could instead make it profitable to protect it.

A critique is not worth much without offering a solution, so in this article I\u2019ll focus on a legacy inspired company governance on the blockchain. How do you ensure both upgradeability and stability. In other words, how do you make sure that people who are using your contract have trust that the entire system they\u2019ve put their livelihoods in won\u2019t fall under their feet and simultaneously ensure that the contract is flexible enough to adapt to changing circumstances? Greg Colvin and I would like to invite the community to come together and participate in improving the Ethereum improvement process (and so much more). We propose to create a Fellowship within which the Ethereum community can self-organize to maximize technical opportunities, share ideas and work together effectively, online and in person, across national, organizational and other boundaries.

To encourage other teams to work on Aragon, we will be splitting off the Foundation to form a company of core developers. An incredible weekend of building and bonding with the Denver community. This past weekend several members of the Aragon team, including Jorge, Luke, Oliver, and myself (John), attended ETHDenver in Colorado, USA. ETHDenver is an Ethereum community event featuring a hackathon and workshops. As we shared previously on the blog, Aragon helped sponsor the event this year and provided bounties for Best App/Integration and Best Proposal. What followed was a whirlwind weekend of hacking, mentoring, learning, and bonding.

Team members will produce a write-up of the most important things they have worked on since last Community Meeting, the problems they have found and what they plan to do in the next weeks (that can be a bit blurry, and that\u2019s fine). These write-ups will be published as a blog post for the community to review on Monday before Friday\u2019s meeting. Empowering unstoppable organizations through freedom of collaboration. Understanding collaboration as the work of two or more people towards the achievement of a common goal, trade is one of the oldest forms of collaboration. The transfer of value between entities has for centuries motivated people to work together to fulfill a greater potential: the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

A critique is not worth much without offering a solution, so in this article I\u2019ll focus on a legacy inspired company governance on the blockchain. How do you ensure both upgradeability and stability. In other words, how do you make sure that people who are using your contract have trust that the entire system they\u2019ve put their livelihoods in won\u2019t fall under their feet and simultaneously ensure that the contract is flexible enough to adapt to changing circumstances?

Blockchain hype is at an all-time high and many people anticipate the first decentralized application to reach the market and gain mass adoption. The term DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) is no longer esoteric. And hundreds of like-minded teams are building decentralized collaborative social news, insurance and investment platforms, numerous collaboration spaces, and even a couple of decentralized autonomous space agencies. Since the \u201chack\u201d of The DAO, this organizational structure has not been much used, I believe partially because of the reputational damage it caused, and partially due to its intrinsic complexity, especially for those who are not familiar with decentralized governance and/or blockchain. Nevertheless, if 2017 has been the year for ICOs, 2018 may be the year for the DAO return.

It facilitates the transfer of its cryptocurrency, can support decentralised applications, and runs smart contracts. Smart contracts run on its blockchain and are the building blocks for ambitious projects, including games like CryptoKitties. To see what lies ahead for Ethereum, MyBroadband spoke to Ethereum developer Nick Johnson about the implications of decentralised organisations. This post is a continuation of part 1, which provided an introduction to blockchain race conditions, front-running, the 0x protocol specification and presented two ways that 0x protocol may be used to implement a decentralized exchange that eliminates front-running and trade collisions by setting the 0x order schema\u2019s taker parameter to an externally owned account (EOA).

Corporations are a Technology, and Blockchains are V2 Ecosystem Ecosystem Author Simon de la Rouviere on Feb 20 Author eBay on Feb 27 Without regulation, it is hard to avoid the abuse of a commons: whether it is water, a pasture or a forest. Even with regulation from governments there are still externalities that exist that are tough to enforce: eg, global regulation is hard, some commons are out of reach of regulation, some commons regulation could still be abused through corruption some externalities are simply never catered for due to the cost in coordination. Instead of trying to force actors to curb the inevitable abuse of a commons, one could instead make it profitable to protect it. We owe corporations credit for much of the last century\u2019s growth and advancement. The profit-motivated and legally-backed corporation operating in a free market is the latest and greatest innovation in how humans cooperate to create things of value. Great corporations constantly reallocate resources to solve problems, and in the process provide for employees and improve products for the public.

Read More DAOs, Democracy and Governance What is a DAO and why is it revolutionary Decentralization 2.0 DAOs DAOs DAOs Author Ralph C. Merkle on May 31, 2016 Author Jo\u00ebl Valenzuela on Dec 11, 2017 Author Joe Iannelli on Feb 21 Democracies are typically seen as governments which call upon the governed to make the major decisions of government: who shall lead, what policies to follow, what laws to enact. In all these matters democracies call upon ordinary citizens to make complex decisions with eventful consequences. First popularized by the ill-fated Ethereum project which resulted in the split to Ethereum Classic, the DAO is a bit of a blockchain buzzword. This innovation extends far beyond simple hype, however, and could revolutionize the way we structure organizations. Here\u2019s a breakdown of what makes a DAO, as well as an explanation of why we should care. Decentralization is what many of us claim to love about blockchain. The idea that our information is not controlled by a centralized server. The idea that a public ledger can be safely maintained without a central entity. The idea that something of value can cross boarders digitally and in only a matter of second or minutes. Blockchain is decentralized already, but what about the teams.

The consultation document proposed three new bills, which cover a broad range of issues. The Aragon Network aims to be a fully digital jurisdiction. By running entirely on the blockchain, it allows DAOs to interact with each other with notable guarantees. These include a decentralized arbitration system and mutual staking just in case any of the arbitration participants needs to be compensated. Collaboration is defined in the dictionary as the situation of two or more people working together to create or achieve the same thing.

Read More DAOs, Democracy and Governance What is a DAO and why is it revolutionary Decentralization 2.0 DAOs DAOs DAOs Author Ralph C. Merkle on May 31, 2016 Author Jo\u00ebl Valenzuela on Dec 11, 2017 Author Joe Iannelli on Feb 21 Democracies are typically seen as governments which call upon the governed to make the major decisions of government: who shall lead, what policies to follow, what laws to enact. In all these matters democracies call upon ordinary citizens to make complex decisions with eventful consequences. First popularized by the ill-fated Ethereum project which resulted in the split to Ethereum Classic, the DAO is a bit of a blockchain buzzword. This innovation extends far beyond simple hype, however, and could revolutionize the way we structure organizations. Here\u2019s a breakdown of what makes a DAO, as well as an explanation of why we should care. Decentralization is what many of us claim to love about blockchain. The idea that our information is not controlled by a centralized server. The idea that a public ledger can be safely maintained without a central entity. The idea that something of value can cross boarders digitally and in only a matter of second or minutes. Blockchain is decentralized already, but what about the teams.

The consultation document proposed three new bills, which cover a broad range of issues. Collaboration is defined in the dictionary as the situation of two or more people working together to create or achieve the same thing.

Curate This: Token Curated Registries That Don\u2019t Work \u2018Hundreds\u2019 Of DAOs Running on Aragon Says CTO In Exclusive Interview DAOs Governance Aragon Author Chelsea Rustrum on Apr 4 Author Aleksandr Bulkin on Apr 12 Author Robert DeVoe on Apr 27 I\u2019d experienced the joy of connecting without money\u200a\u2014\u200asharing meals and homes with complete strangers on Couchsurfing.com, gifting access to my car while I traveled, and experimenting with random acts of generosity. These experiences were so transformational that I volunteered to help shoot a documentary, One Couch at a Time, which highlighted the relational aspects of the burgeoning sharing economy. Token curated registries (TCRs) are an economically incentivized mechanism that promises to address a serious need in decentralized systems: to provide a reliable signal of quality on something you can\u2019t directly observe. Some examples of questions that TCRs are intended to answer: Is John a good roommate? Is Guggenheim a good museum? Is Neptune Diner worth having lunch at? We caught up with one of the co-founders and company CTO Jorge Izquierdo at the Shanghai Ethereum Meetup to talk about his project and the recent developments they\u2019ve had as they move into their next version of the software, v0.5.

Here's Why It's Going to Become The Hottest New Type of Corporation DAOstack brings Decentralized Governance to Gnosis Graded Token-Curated Decisions with Up-/Downvoting DAOs Governance Governance Author Darren Heitner on Apr 27 Author Nadja Bene\u0161 on Apr 30 Author Sebastian Gajek on May 1 You may have not heard of the abbreviation DAO, but it is a term that should keep popping up with more frequency during the blockchain boom. It stands for decentralized autonomous organizations. As companies are betting on and adopting blockchain, many believing that blockchain is the future, DAO could start playing an even bigger role. Gnosis is proud to announce that it is entering into a partnership with DAOstack. Together, Gnosis and DAOstack will build autonomous, self-governing, reputation-based communities that empower millions of users on their platform. The founders of Gnosis and DAOstack respectively, have had a close relationship for many years consequently and will look to be united in their mission together. A Graded Token-Curated Decision Protocol is a cryptoeconomic mechanism allowing an amorphous group of token holders to up- or downrank an object.

Some examples of questions that TCRs are intended to answer: Is John a good roommate? Is Guggenheim a good museum? Is Neptune Diner worth having lunch at? Gnosis is proud to announce that it is entering into a partnership with DAOstack. Together, Gnosis and DAOstack will build autonomous, self-governing, reputation-based communities that empower millions of users on their platform. The founders of Gnosis and DAOstack respectively, have had a close relationship for many years consequently and will look to be united in their mission together. A Graded Token-Curated Decision Protocol is a cryptoeconomic mechanism allowing an amorphous group of token holders to up- or downrank an object.

Art from the Song Dynasty\u200a\u2014\u200aChina\u2019s age of invention // The first few paragraphs is just context, skip down to the next big header for the meat of the article. It has been three years since the launch of Ethereum and it has taken the center stage of the global tech community. Decisions over the future of Ethereum now reverberate louder than ever and it was a matter of time before we all had to address how we govern ourselves. In April this year, EIP999 was created and the community was once again reminded of the DAO hardfork. Contentious and without finality: Was the DAO hardfork the right decision? Should Parity be allowed to amend the blockchain and recover the funds? It sparked an awareness and in response to this, EIP0 was born. Held days before the start of EDCON 2018, it was a three day invitational hackathon which looked to discover Ethereum could be better governed. Three days passed and little tangible progress was made. But nonetheless, the important first step was taken. With more questions than answers, we all became aware of the mountain in front of us all. What did governance mean and what did it entail? How were decisions going to be made? And based on what? What were the values of Ethereum? What values did the community believe in and embody? These were big questions and required more than a few blog posts to resolve. It required organized effort. Half a month later, Jarred Hope created a community survey and gathered 200 responses. The looked to diagnose potential problems of Ethereum. It looked to discover the values of ethereum, its moments of greatness but also its flaws. And while some may argue about the sample size of the community and the crudeness of the survey itself, it produced valuable data which we never had access to before. Responses varied between entertaining, funny and outright frustrated. After reading through most of everything, I personally found these two questions the most interesting\u2026 Is there anything we \u2018failed\u2019 or are \u2018failing\u2019 at? Is there anything in Ethereum (past/present) that frustrated you, or could have been done better? Answers to these questions were honest and blunt but also, the data we needed to grow. I was able to organise and map out all the common concerns raised by the responses. Let\u2019s take a look! Ideas board: https://www.figma.com/file/I0r0qsykpH459ti94LrVql3q/EIP0-Responses I did a bit of poking around and discovered trends amongst the concerns raised about Ethereum. And while popularity does not necessarily equate to their urgency but nonetheless they are important to address. 1. How do we govern Ethereum? While not a surprise, governance was on the top of the proverbial list. With nearly over a third of people believing Ethereum to be failing at governance, we had replies about how Ethreum failed to learn from the DAO hardkfork and how there was little clarity and order around the current governance process. \u201c\u2026the post-parity hack discussions were kind of a mess. Everyone seemed to be talking over each other, rather than at each other. No one seemed to understand each other\u2019s perspectives\u201d Some called for greater consideration when handling governance. While it is too easy to say \u201cdon\u2019t make it personal\u201d, the matter of fact is that when you are dealing with personal reputation, egos, other peoples money and the core values of others, it becomes a complicated matter. \u201cEmpathy is key\u201d Others believed that our mistakes would come back to haunt us all. Many believed that how events such as the DAO hack and parity hack were handled disappointingly. \u201cThe DAO hardfork. The way it was decided and communicated was against what I believed Ethereum was about\u201d \u201cWe did the DAO fork for historically understandable reasons and it worked out OK, but this has spawned various misconceived attempts to govern it that would be better done on a different platform or around a different token on top of Ethereum\u201d \u201cEIP 999 discussion was not managed well (I was not in favor of it, but that was not the point). Also, Vitalik introducing the April Fools hardcap \u201cjoke\u201d wasn\u2019t really a great way to introduce such an important discussion. Also, in general, we don\u2019t put enough emphasis on user experience in actually using Ethereum\u201d The discussion thread for EIP999\u200a\u2014\u200aPainting from the Qing Dynasty, Guangxu Period Is this governance a problem? Definitely. Do we have a solution? No. But I think we can do a lot to make the process of finding one smoother. We need to be considerate of the fact that in most governance cases, SOMEONE or a group will need to make a decision or as the CEO of Uber says \u2018the D\u2019. Good calls will be made but so will bad ones. That sourness is inherently unavoidable yet we pretend to live in a world without disappointment. Many times the person you are twitter flaming is just as passionate as the problem as you are and simply wants the best outcome. Instead of the uncontrollable \u2018right\u2019 and \u2018wrong\u2019, we should be focusing on making better decisions over time. With so much at stake, it is like Poker. You must play without emotion but with belief and aggression. To be a winning player, you must make the right call at all times without baggage from previous failures or fear of future ones. However in order to do that, we must be led by values and a shared vision. Hard and controversial decisions like EIP999 won\u2019t be the last difficult one that Ethereum has to deal with. And when the darkest hours of the night come, we can still depend on that origin mission that united everyone together in the first place. Hypothesis We all touched upon this at the end of EIP0\u200a\u2014\u200acommunication. While people might comment on disorganization, lack of clarity or criticism of the decisions made, I believe they are underlying symptoms of poor communication. The governance decision making process is opaque and strewn all over the place from twitter threads to obscure wordpress blogs. We need a community recognized stage where all governance related issues are documented and collected. This is the core of the dilemma. Any work that involves representing the system takes time and effort out of the system it represents. We don\u2019t have a formal way of allocating resources for this. A chicken and the egg problem. Who was in the decision making process? Which group made the final decision? Who supported the decision? Who didn\u2019t? How can Ethereum learn from such decisions in the future? What would determine the success of the decision? What would mean a failure? If either happened, what part of the decision making rationale would need to be reviewed? If we are able to document those aspects of decisions, we would not only improve the visibility of governance, improve communication but also be able to learn from our ability to govern. But before we even attempt to solve and improve the communications of Ethereum, we need to establish what that very governance will be led by. What are our values? What does Ethereum stand for? What do we want Ethereum to become? While some people are immutability maximalists, some aren\u2019t. There is a reason for forks. Ethereum needs to decide on what it aims to be and create a united clear vision. I believe that we can worry about all the messy details of ordering EIPs and decentralising control after there is an established vision. Everything else will follow. Only then can we then move with rigor and make decisions with full conviction. \u201cCommunication. We need to bridge the gaps in communication. However, it is hard if we don\u2019t even agree on what are our shared values.\u201c James Hancock mentioned how that politics 50 years ago is not politics today, politics 50 years ago will not be the same as today. Locking ourselves into a set of ideals now, not only has its worries, it is impossible to know what the belief systems of the future will be. We are ever evolving groups that change and grow over time. Going forward action items: What does Ethereum want to be? What is its vision? What values does Ethereum embody? What the boundaries of Ethereum?\u200a\u2014\u200a Start writing and releasing manifestos written by teams or individuals? We need better communication of problems along with greater visibility and clarity behind the governance rationale\u200a\u2014\u200a Establish a central stage where all aspects of governance can be documented? We need full time focus on governance. They need to be the right people and I don\u2019t mean people with credentials. They need to be people who truly care about Ethereum and people you believe and trust in\u200a\u2014\u200a Fund individuals to figure out governance. \u201cEthereum wide product managers who present problems and facilitate problem solving\u201d (Sounds similar to politicians? eh.) 2. What is the Ethereum Foundation? Unlike concerns about the governance of issues like EIP999, there was a wide angle of issues directed towards the Ethereum Foundation (EF). Responses had concerns over the direction of funding. How much, when and who. Is funding going to the right places? How is funding decided upon? Who is it decided by? Who controls the EF? Who works for the EF? How is the organisation structured? How can others participate in the governance of the Ethereum Foundation? Sounds like a lot of ambiguity! Let\u2019s take a look at the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s mission on their website\u2026 The Ethereum Foundation\u2019s mission is to promote and support Ethereum platform and base layer research, development and education to bring decentralized protocols and tools to the world that empower developers to produce next generation decentralized applications (dapps), and together build a more globally accessible, more free and more trustworthy Internet. What other functions is it involved in? How does it stay impartial? Where does the influence of the EF start and end? The Ethereum foundation holds a lot of centralized weight, influence and financial ability in the Ethereum space and thus why we should all be concerned with its conduct. Whether it is good or not, they hold responsibility on the same level as state nations in maintaining and funding public goods. \u201cits a trap\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aquote from the General Ackbar, a song dynasty commander \u201cI\u2019ve always felt that the Ethereum Foundation could\u2019ve fostered a more radical approach: radical transparency more radical openness\u201d \u201cWhile not \u201cfailing,\u201d I feel that the Ethereum Foundation needs to become increasingly decentralized and transparent. This could take the form of adding more contributors, more articles about what is being worked on, and so on. We want to avoid the perception that decisions and meaningful work is happening in the proverbial smoke-filled room\u201d \u201cWhat is going on with the EF vs Ethereum Research? Why isn\u2019t tons of money being directed by those orgs (does only one have money?) into real core development? The grant program is a start but needs 10x and better coordination / visibility\u201d Hypothesis Again I think the wide range of concerns surrounding the Foundation can be solved with clearer clarification of what the Ethereum Foundation is and what it is not. Unless better ongoing communication happens, there will always be a blurred sense of ambiguity. This then can potentially distort the weight of its power in areas in which it should not involve itself in. In terms of transparency of operations, this is likely to have been a highly discussed topic within the organisation and the current situation is likely to be where it is for a good reason. I personally believe that with so much weight in the community, it should operate with absolute transparency. I give massive props to the transparency of Aragon\u2019s quarterly reports (salaries, expenses, auditing costs, bounties etc.) where the financials are published out into the open. I also suggest looking at how the Zcash Foundation conducts grant funding\u200a\u2014\u200aeverything is organized in github issues where dialogue is open to the public. Rejections and accepted grant applications are all visible. I really appreciate that and hope Ethereum could move toward something similar. There were other problems addressed such as impartiality and issues over the potential political centralization of the Ethereum but I think if we care about them, then they will show through our values. And if we are led by our values then it will be fought for. Going forward action items: What is Ethereum Foundation\u2019s specific function within the community? What is it involved with? Events, grants or even media? Where do the responsibilities start and end?\u200a\u2014\u200a Clarify Implement transparency\u200a\u2014\u200a As discussed Conclusion I think these suggestions could provide for a first step and serve well as the start of discourse threads. I am only one person, please help drive this. There are many things which I haven\u2019t addressed! Please explore the responses yourself. More interpretations are welcome. Happy to contribute.

Art from the Song Dynasty\u200a\u2014\u200aChina\u2019s age of invention // The first few paragraphs is just context, skip down to the next big header for the meat of the article. It has been three years since the launch of Ethereum and it has taken the center stage of the global tech community. Decisions over the future of Ethereum now reverberate louder than ever and it was a matter of time before we all had to address how we govern ourselves. In April this year, EIP999 was created and the community was once again reminded of the DAO hardfork. Contentious and without finality: Was the DAO hardfork the right decision? Should Parity be allowed to amend the blockchain and recover the funds? It sparked an awareness and in response to this, EIP0 was born. Held days before the start of EDCON 2018, it was a three day invitational hackathon which looked to discover Ethereum could be better governed. Three days passed and little tangible progress was made. But nonetheless, the important first step was taken. With more questions than answers, we all became aware of the mountain in front of us all. What did governance mean and what did it entail? How were decisions going to be made? And based on what? What were the values of Ethereum? What values did the community believe in and embody? These were big questions and required more than a few blog posts to resolve. It required organized effort. Half a month later, Jarred Hope created a community survey and gathered 200 responses. The looked to diagnose potential problems of Ethereum. It looked to discover the values of ethereum, its moments of greatness but also its flaws. And while some may argue about the sample size of the community and the crudeness of the survey itself, it produced valuable data which we never had access to before. Responses varied between entertaining, funny and outright frustrated. After reading through most of everything, I personally found these two questions the most interesting\u2026 Is there anything we \u2018failed\u2019 or are \u2018failing\u2019 at? Is there anything in Ethereum (past/present) that frustrated you, or could have been done better? Answers to these questions were honest and blunt but also, the data we needed to grow. I was able to organise and map out all the common concerns raised by the responses. Let\u2019s take a look! Ideas board: https://www.figma.com/file/I0r0qsykpH459ti94LrVql3q/EIP0-Responses I did a bit of poking around and discovered trends amongst the concerns raised about Ethereum.

Author Pet3rpan","title":"Conclusion"},{"location":"archive/issue06/articles/opinion/governance_through_code/","text":"Governance Through Code The biggest evolution in governance since the invention of the company Author Thijs Maas / @ThijsMaasLaw Throughout time governance has been the single most important tool for us, homo sapiens, to thrive. Our capability to form complex governance structures made us distinguish ourselves from other animals. More recently governance structures have become solidified in systems of bureaucracy and business hierarchies. Governance truly is the glue that holds together human societies and it is therefore still our most important tool. With the rise of the internet and advances in cryptography, online communities and new forms of governance are increasingly emerging. In fact, governance through code is the single largest innovation in the field of governance since the company. Yet, new advances made in this area barely get the attention they deserve. Tribal Governance First however, let us go back in time. Back to our forefathers, of which there were no more than 10.000 on the face of the entire planet. Back to a time where we weren\u2019t the only type of humans around. Yes, you read that right: 70.000 years ago, there were multiple species of intellectually evolved monkeys walking the face of the earth. We, the homo sapiens, were only one of many. Contrary to popular belief, other human species, such as the homo soloensis , the homo denisova and the neanderthals had evolved separately from homo sapiens. Yet, about 30.000 years ago they had all vanished from the planet. Scholars increasingly agree that there is a good possibility that we, homo sapiens, have eradicated them all. This raises questions. How? Why us? What had made homo sapiens capable of wiping out all these species? How come we are here to ponder these questions, instead of the far stronger neanderthals, who had also evolved cognitively? The answer lies in governance. We, homo sapiens, are inherently territorial. To ensure survival, we organized in tribes which worked together to hunt and gather. As a tribe, having control over one's own territory for hunting and gathering was advantageous, so we would fight with others over fertile lands. Of course, we did not actually 'own' territories as many other animals made more use of it than us. However, the sense of territorial ownership gave us common goals and allowed us to organize ourselves to pursue them. Living in tribes in order to pursue our territorial interests has allowed us to govern ourselves effectively. Most species of the homo family were not capable of maintaining a tribe larger than about 50 individuals. When a tribe grew in size, members would generally fight amongst themselves or split up. Not homo sapiens though. Research indicates that our better-developed communicative skills allowed us to form groups of up to 150 individuals. The most important aspect of our communication, was that we were able to talk about others behind their backs effectively. Although seemingly trivial, this allowed us to form complex social relations, which helped the tribe understand the established hierarchy. As such, our governance was better than the governance in tribes of other cognitively developed human-like species. Religion and Law-Based Governance As time progressed we became increasingly skilled in organizing ourselves. Throughout the cognitive revolution we learned to communicate about things that we had never seen, heard or smelled. As our language evolved, we gained the ability to communicate about myths in all shapes or forms. We started talking about our superstitions and, over time, a wide variety of religions emerged. Of course, these did not exist anywhere but in our minds. Just like our ideas of territorial ownership, they were solely social constructs. However, these early religions helped us to further develop an understanding about what is good and bad behavior - not just towards the gods but also towards each other. For example, killing a member of your own tribe near the river is bad and it might piss of a water spirit. As such, others in the tribe would punish you for it. This decision mechanism to punish a killer is an early form of governance based on natural law. The decision to punish was not made out of impulse or because the alpha male dictated it, but the killer violated a common understanding about how the community was to behave. As such, belief in a religious myth helped communities to govern itself more effectively \u2013 and grow as a result. We fast forward through time, as religious myths kept forming the glue to allow us to function as a society for most of history. Over the span of history, our religious beliefs has allowed us to form increasingly complex legal systems based on natural law. These systems allowed us to form more stable societies and as law dictated what behavior was accepted, people could be appointed to enforce it. Just like religion and territorial beliefs, our notion of law is a social construct. It doesn\u2019t exist anywhere but in our minds. Once again however, this social construct allowed us to better govern ourselves. It worked so well, that as civilization grew increasingly complex, we started codifying our legal beliefs, first in ancient Egypt and later in ancient Greece and the Roman Empire. Not coincidentally, this went hand in hand with the codification of organizational structures. Our governance became codified law. Still, we did remain territorial. Territorial conquest and commonalities between local tribes led to increasingly bigger communities and finally even nation-states and empires, which were sustainable due to our newly found belief in codified governance. Although better organized, we would still focus on the same kind of territorial conquest that tribes had pursued. Complete empires emerged, with effective systems of delegation of power. Territorial beliefs gave people a common sense of union with other citizens of an empire. Today, we call such beliefs nationalism. Corporate Governance From the 16th century onwards, nationalism increasingly became a problem. By now, we realized that there was substantial money to be made in global trade, and we had started colonizing most of the known world to capitalize on it. However, colonial rebellions based on nationalist beliefs and complex diplomatic relations between colonizers made it increasingly difficult for states to trade effectively. Realizing these restraints on the nations\u2019 trade, daring traders came up with a new form of governance to capitalize on the opportunity at hand. In 1602, Dutch East India Company was established. It marked the beginning of a new era of governance. In essence, we had managed to make up a new social construct to allow us to govern ourselves effectively: the publicly traded company. This new construct, rooted in our system of codified legal beliefs, allowed us to imagine a new \u2018entity\u2019 that would exist separately from its earthly assets, owners and employees. Each of the three can be replaced and the legal entity will continue to exist. Like an imagined deity, concept of state, money or legal system, this entity exists in our minds only. In Sapiens, Yuval Noah Harari illustrates this beautifully: People easily understand that primitives cement their social order by believing in sorcerers, ghosts and spirits, and gathering each full moon to dance together around the campfire. What we fail to appreciate is that our modern institutions function on exactly the same basis. Modern Business-people and lawyers are, in fact, powerful sorcerers.[\u2026] If a priest goes through all the required spells and oaths, exclaims \u2018Hoc est corpus meum!\u2019, then hocus popus - bread is turned into Christ\u2019s flesh. In the same fashion, when a lawyer goes through all the required spells and oaths, using a nicely decorated piece of paper, affixing his ornate signature to a piece of paper, then hocus pocus, a company is created. Today, governance through the concept of big multinational companies has arguably become more powerful than territorial or religious governance. In fact, in the past 400 years, shareholder-value maximizing companies have led to more technological achievement and welfare than ever before. The revenue of the biggest corporations now dwarfs the GDP of most states. So how has this new kind of organization become so important? Simply said, corporate governance unites people on the basis of one very strong common interest: making money. Ever since people in the developed world don\u2019t have to focus on survival, they have focused on accruing as much money as possible. Money, together with status, is what drives us, and companies are effective because all stakeholders in a company are united by having a financial interest in the success of the company. Over time, we started figuring out the best way to be governed within a company, and so, the field of corporate governance emerged. This field is occupied with patterns of rule within businesses \u2013 with the systems, institutions and norms by which businesses are directed and controlled. Code-Based Governance Now, a new form of governance is appearing. This new form of organizing ourselves has been made possible by a great human achievement: the creation of the internet. This worldwide communication system has led to radical changes in our daily lives. For the first time, people all around the world are able to communicate with each other instantly. This communication is allowing us to form new communities. These communities are not very different from early tribes, albeit they are not based on territorial beliefs or religious myths. Instead, they have organically emerged around shared commonalities and interests between people all over the world. On Reddit alone, you can find over 1.2 million of these communities. Community governance is implemented through voting systems and moderation, based on shared beliefs on the kind of content and behavior that is to be allowed in the subforum. Communities are increasingly distinctive from each other due to distinctive uses of language and memes that are specific to the forum. What\u2019s more, we are even starting to see rivalries between these communities; a form of new-age tribalism. One of the more important tribes was organized around an electronic mailing since the late 1980s. Going by the name of \u2018cypherpunks\u2019, a group of individuals with shared beliefs about the importance of cryptography and privacy-enhancing technologies continuously explored a number of technical, cryptographic concepts. Many of these concepts would later form the basis for a new myth to believe in. This myth would be the feasibility of an existence completely separate from today\u2019s social constructs such as the state, banks and corporations. It was named Bitcoin. Many rejected the idea instantly as a surreal daydream of magical internet money created out of thin air. However, Bitcoin kept being developed by a community of online developers with similar beliefs about the faults of our current monetary system and the ability of central banks - the most powerful corporations in the world - to print money on its own discretion. Their solution, an online currency with a fixed-supply, is extremely elegantly designed. Bitcoin\u2019s community exists of users, investors, miners (the parties that make sure the system is safe), developers and nodes (the parties that basically keep miners in check). None of these parties actually have to know each other to add value to the community. Instead, they only have to believe in the newly found social construct called Bitcoin, and its underlying code. Bitcoin\u2019s governance resembles the governance of governmental systems. In a blogpost, titled \u2018Blockchain Governance: Programming Our Future\u2019, Fred Ehrsam illustrates this beautifully: \u201cSimilar to the Senate submitting new bills, developers submit pull requests. Similar to the judiciary, miners decide whether or not to actually adopt the laws in practice. Similar to the executive branch, the nodes of the network can veto by not running a version which aligns with what the miners are running. And similar to citizens, the users can revolt. Finally, economic incentives dictate that it is in everyone\u2019s best interest to maintain trust in the system. For example: if miners alienated all the users, the tokens would decrease in value and they would go out of business.\u201c Bitcoin has shown that governance through code, combined with a religious belief in a common interest, seems to be a viable way for humans to organize themselves. Bitcoins, and other cryptographic tokens, create network effects and align interests between stakeholders within the ecosystem. Everyone who owns bitcoin has an incentive to contribute value to the project, by for example, preaching its benefits to the outside world. Additional financial incentives can be encoded in a currency\u2019s codebase to encourage specific behavior. For example, projects like Golem and Filecoin award people for renting out their computer\u2019s storage capacity. By effective application of game theory and, more specifically, mechanism design, such financial incentives can be further fine-tuned. Meanwhile, reliable voting mechanisms can be implemented using blockchains, by having cryptocurrency holders \u2018stake\u2019 their tokens in order to signal their vote about specific topics. Implementations hereof are found in the governance of projects like Decred and Augur. In Decred, this voting mechanism is pretty straight-forward. Augur on the other hand is a prediction market which allows people to stake money on expected outcomes of events. If you are right, you are rewarded in tokens and if you\u2019re wrong you are punished, which essentially creates a market for the predictions on the future. This has all led to a renewed interest in how we can effectively govern ourselves in a digital age. Increasingly, forms of governance such as liquid democracy, quadratic voting, futarchy and meritocracy are re-examined. At the same time, a new kind of organization is emerging: the decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO. It is an organization that is run through the rules encoded as computer programs called smart contracts. The first, and most well-known DAO was, not coincidentally called The DAO. It was coded to function as an investment fund, which allowed all who bought its tokens to vote on how the funds should invest its money. As most are aware, The DAO was a gigantic failure. It had loopholes in its code, which resulted in it being hacked almost immediately. Sadly, this has had a significant negative impact in the online blockchain communities\u2019 interest in DAOs. So, what\u2019s the point of this article? Only by understanding that effective governance has historically been the most important factor of human survival, evolution and progress, we can appreciate the opportunities that are found in the concept of governance through code. Only by understanding our history we can understand its significance for our future. Realizing all this, it is essential that we keep experimenting with code-based governance. This is exactly the reason why I applaud Aragon, a project that is building the infrastructure to support these experiments. Aragon\u2019s platform allows for governance applications to be built and shared between organizations, and experimental forms of governance to be tested and gradually implemented to ensure safety. The aim is for new kinds of organizations to exist outside of the conventional, territorial, legal systems of today. To make this possible, the project is even building its own digital jurisdiction, complete with a decentralized arbitration system. In case of a dispute about the (mal)functioning of a DAO\u2019s code, a number of jurors will be randomly chosen to vote on how the dispute should be resolved. They are incentivized to act in an honest and rational manner: if their vote coincides with the vote of the majority of jurors, they are rewarded in; if not, they are punished. It is time for us to accept that blockchain-projects are more than just magical internet money. They are experiments in what could prove to be the greatest evolution in human governance since the invention of the company.","title":"Governance Through Code"},{"location":"archive/issue06/articles/opinion/governance_through_code/#governance-through-code","text":"The biggest evolution in governance since the invention of the company Author Thijs Maas / @ThijsMaasLaw Throughout time governance has been the single most important tool for us, homo sapiens, to thrive. Our capability to form complex governance structures made us distinguish ourselves from other animals. More recently governance structures have become solidified in systems of bureaucracy and business hierarchies. Governance truly is the glue that holds together human societies and it is therefore still our most important tool. With the rise of the internet and advances in cryptography, online communities and new forms of governance are increasingly emerging. In fact, governance through code is the single largest innovation in the field of governance since the company. Yet, new advances made in this area barely get the attention they deserve.","title":"Governance Through Code"},{"location":"archive/issue06/articles/opinion/governance_through_code/#tribal-governance","text":"First however, let us go back in time. Back to our forefathers, of which there were no more than 10.000 on the face of the entire planet. Back to a time where we weren\u2019t the only type of humans around. Yes, you read that right: 70.000 years ago, there were multiple species of intellectually evolved monkeys walking the face of the earth. We, the homo sapiens, were only one of many. Contrary to popular belief, other human species, such as the homo soloensis , the homo denisova and the neanderthals had evolved separately from homo sapiens. Yet, about 30.000 years ago they had all vanished from the planet. Scholars increasingly agree that there is a good possibility that we, homo sapiens, have eradicated them all. This raises questions. How? Why us? What had made homo sapiens capable of wiping out all these species? How come we are here to ponder these questions, instead of the far stronger neanderthals, who had also evolved cognitively? The answer lies in governance. We, homo sapiens, are inherently territorial. To ensure survival, we organized in tribes which worked together to hunt and gather. As a tribe, having control over one's own territory for hunting and gathering was advantageous, so we would fight with others over fertile lands. Of course, we did not actually 'own' territories as many other animals made more use of it than us. However, the sense of territorial ownership gave us common goals and allowed us to organize ourselves to pursue them. Living in tribes in order to pursue our territorial interests has allowed us to govern ourselves effectively. Most species of the homo family were not capable of maintaining a tribe larger than about 50 individuals. When a tribe grew in size, members would generally fight amongst themselves or split up. Not homo sapiens though. Research indicates that our better-developed communicative skills allowed us to form groups of up to 150 individuals. The most important aspect of our communication, was that we were able to talk about others behind their backs effectively. Although seemingly trivial, this allowed us to form complex social relations, which helped the tribe understand the established hierarchy. As such, our governance was better than the governance in tribes of other cognitively developed human-like species.","title":"Tribal Governance"},{"location":"archive/issue06/articles/opinion/governance_through_code/#religion-and-law-based-governance","text":"As time progressed we became increasingly skilled in organizing ourselves. Throughout the cognitive revolution we learned to communicate about things that we had never seen, heard or smelled. As our language evolved, we gained the ability to communicate about myths in all shapes or forms. We started talking about our superstitions and, over time, a wide variety of religions emerged. Of course, these did not exist anywhere but in our minds. Just like our ideas of territorial ownership, they were solely social constructs. However, these early religions helped us to further develop an understanding about what is good and bad behavior - not just towards the gods but also towards each other. For example, killing a member of your own tribe near the river is bad and it might piss of a water spirit. As such, others in the tribe would punish you for it. This decision mechanism to punish a killer is an early form of governance based on natural law. The decision to punish was not made out of impulse or because the alpha male dictated it, but the killer violated a common understanding about how the community was to behave. As such, belief in a religious myth helped communities to govern itself more effectively \u2013 and grow as a result. We fast forward through time, as religious myths kept forming the glue to allow us to function as a society for most of history. Over the span of history, our religious beliefs has allowed us to form increasingly complex legal systems based on natural law. These systems allowed us to form more stable societies and as law dictated what behavior was accepted, people could be appointed to enforce it. Just like religion and territorial beliefs, our notion of law is a social construct. It doesn\u2019t exist anywhere but in our minds. Once again however, this social construct allowed us to better govern ourselves. It worked so well, that as civilization grew increasingly complex, we started codifying our legal beliefs, first in ancient Egypt and later in ancient Greece and the Roman Empire. Not coincidentally, this went hand in hand with the codification of organizational structures. Our governance became codified law. Still, we did remain territorial. Territorial conquest and commonalities between local tribes led to increasingly bigger communities and finally even nation-states and empires, which were sustainable due to our newly found belief in codified governance. Although better organized, we would still focus on the same kind of territorial conquest that tribes had pursued. Complete empires emerged, with effective systems of delegation of power. Territorial beliefs gave people a common sense of union with other citizens of an empire. Today, we call such beliefs nationalism.","title":"Religion and Law-Based Governance"},{"location":"archive/issue06/articles/opinion/governance_through_code/#corporate-governance","text":"From the 16th century onwards, nationalism increasingly became a problem. By now, we realized that there was substantial money to be made in global trade, and we had started colonizing most of the known world to capitalize on it. However, colonial rebellions based on nationalist beliefs and complex diplomatic relations between colonizers made it increasingly difficult for states to trade effectively. Realizing these restraints on the nations\u2019 trade, daring traders came up with a new form of governance to capitalize on the opportunity at hand. In 1602, Dutch East India Company was established. It marked the beginning of a new era of governance. In essence, we had managed to make up a new social construct to allow us to govern ourselves effectively: the publicly traded company. This new construct, rooted in our system of codified legal beliefs, allowed us to imagine a new \u2018entity\u2019 that would exist separately from its earthly assets, owners and employees. Each of the three can be replaced and the legal entity will continue to exist. Like an imagined deity, concept of state, money or legal system, this entity exists in our minds only. In Sapiens, Yuval Noah Harari illustrates this beautifully: People easily understand that primitives cement their social order by believing in sorcerers, ghosts and spirits, and gathering each full moon to dance together around the campfire. What we fail to appreciate is that our modern institutions function on exactly the same basis. Modern Business-people and lawyers are, in fact, powerful sorcerers.[\u2026] If a priest goes through all the required spells and oaths, exclaims \u2018Hoc est corpus meum!\u2019, then hocus popus - bread is turned into Christ\u2019s flesh. In the same fashion, when a lawyer goes through all the required spells and oaths, using a nicely decorated piece of paper, affixing his ornate signature to a piece of paper, then hocus pocus, a company is created. Today, governance through the concept of big multinational companies has arguably become more powerful than territorial or religious governance. In fact, in the past 400 years, shareholder-value maximizing companies have led to more technological achievement and welfare than ever before. The revenue of the biggest corporations now dwarfs the GDP of most states. So how has this new kind of organization become so important? Simply said, corporate governance unites people on the basis of one very strong common interest: making money. Ever since people in the developed world don\u2019t have to focus on survival, they have focused on accruing as much money as possible. Money, together with status, is what drives us, and companies are effective because all stakeholders in a company are united by having a financial interest in the success of the company. Over time, we started figuring out the best way to be governed within a company, and so, the field of corporate governance emerged. This field is occupied with patterns of rule within businesses \u2013 with the systems, institutions and norms by which businesses are directed and controlled.","title":"Corporate Governance"},{"location":"archive/issue06/articles/opinion/governance_through_code/#code-based-governance","text":"Now, a new form of governance is appearing. This new form of organizing ourselves has been made possible by a great human achievement: the creation of the internet. This worldwide communication system has led to radical changes in our daily lives. For the first time, people all around the world are able to communicate with each other instantly. This communication is allowing us to form new communities. These communities are not very different from early tribes, albeit they are not based on territorial beliefs or religious myths. Instead, they have organically emerged around shared commonalities and interests between people all over the world. On Reddit alone, you can find over 1.2 million of these communities. Community governance is implemented through voting systems and moderation, based on shared beliefs on the kind of content and behavior that is to be allowed in the subforum. Communities are increasingly distinctive from each other due to distinctive uses of language and memes that are specific to the forum. What\u2019s more, we are even starting to see rivalries between these communities; a form of new-age tribalism. One of the more important tribes was organized around an electronic mailing since the late 1980s. Going by the name of \u2018cypherpunks\u2019, a group of individuals with shared beliefs about the importance of cryptography and privacy-enhancing technologies continuously explored a number of technical, cryptographic concepts. Many of these concepts would later form the basis for a new myth to believe in.

That is Aragon's premise, but how on earth can you build such a thing? You need a set of rules that everyone must follow in order to achieve any given organization goals. The must is the hard part, people do things for different reasons, and interests not always align, so you need a system that can incentivize good behavior while punishing bad behavior. Sounds familiar? This is what governments all around the world do. If you behave like a good citizen (by paying taxes, for example) you are \"rewarded\" by allowing you to get a job, get a government issued ID/drivers license, etc. If you don't behave, you go to jail, get fined and/or barred from certain communities, for example, if you are a doctor and kill someone because of negligence, you get expelled from the medic community and forbidden to exercise your profession. Enter governance. To start, it may be good to define what governance is and then we can drill down into why it is important. \"Governance is the process of establishing and maintaining the legitimacy of decision-making processes\" If you don't have any governance, you lack direction or common goals, causing confusion and disorder. Hence, governance is an important topic that touches everyone's lives in some way or another. With our current system, a government is established, ground rules are set in the form of a constitution, and everyone in that same jurisdiction agrees to follow those ground rules. The Internet has enabled collaboration from individuals residing in different countries and jurisdictions. These jurisdictions are not always compatible with each other, which leads to all sorts of issues that affect productivity between them. For example, someone in Venezuela can't easily send a payment to another party in the US without incurring extremely expensive foreign exchange fees. Or think about someone in Cuba trying to open a business with a Costa Rican partner, each party would need to open their own subsidiary in each country, and in the case of Cuba, the best you can hope for is a 50-50 joint venture with the government [1]: taxes and laws are so different that having a common company is impossible. So, to build unstoppable organizations, you need to start by laying some ground rules that everyone participating agrees with. More importantly, you need to be able to adapt your governance systems to a constantly changing environment, and do it in a way transparent enough so that all participants can clearly see why any decision was made. In a Medium article by Fred Ehrsam [2] he says that governance is the most vital problem in the space, and fundamental problems can be solved by creating the right incentives for people with adequate skills to solve the problem. A project is just as good as the people behind it. If you have a clear governance process, you can pull talent from wherever it resides, and avoid painful arguments that leave nothing more than people screaming at each other over a mailing list. There are multiple projects besides Aragon trying to define new ways of Governance that can endure. Decred , for example, aims to solve the problems that Bitcoin has in its governance by implementing a consensus voting model that empowers stakeholders and allows for the seamless transition from one set of rules to another. This makes the project move at a faster pace than Bitcoin since all stakeholders incentives are aligned with the development of the project itself. Governance issues have plagued Bitcoin with multiple forks, community splits, and inability to move forward on certain Bitcoin Improvement Proposals . Aragon takes governance one step further, by not just allowing voting, but providing a platform to implement whole digital jurisdictions. The value of this can't be underestimated, a digital jurisdiction enables all participants to know the rules and automatically (via smart contracts) incentivizes good behavior by rewarding it, while punishing lechers or people trying to harm the organization. It also completely erases the problem with incompatible jurisdictions, since you are now playing by the rules set by a group of people that have similar goals, and we all know 2 heads (or a million) are better than 1!

White skin, dressed in all black. Rash guard, board shorts, and a burn bag with a first aid kit, water shoes, and fins. Sweating from the anxiety, Kamaria knew that the trip she\u2019d make in several hours could end in her throat being cut by smugglers, or police kidnapping her again. They were in a tourist district, not too far from the hotels. Moms held kids and rucksacks, while dads pointed cameras out the bus windows taking shots of Seljuk buildings and mustached Dondurma vendors tricking tourists into reaching for their waffle cones. A few months earlier a former Turkish military man had shown her the site where she was headed. He had done so as a joke, not thinking that she would ever end up coming back. At the time, Kamaria didn\u2019t either. It was only a while later that she realized it was the perfect spot to stand watch. Several hours after the bus had dropped her off, she headed towards the long pier, about a kilometer away from the closest hotel. She had to wait another 6 to 7 hours before the boats would start leaving port. Watching with binoculars pressed tightly to her eyes, she would count the number of boats to undock and later warn her contacts on the Greece coastline of how many refugees they should expect. The Failure of Government Political and economic collapse in Venezuela, the flood of refugees from Syria, China\u2019s transformation into a police state, and the US\u2019s failed democracy are awakening the world to the instability of government, the corruption of wealth and corporations, and the lack of freedom for societies all around the world. For thousands of years we\u2019ve been attempting to iterate on a model of governance that has failed to scale to accommodate a globalized world focused on the individual liberties of humankind. And now we\u2019re coming to terms with the consequences. Globally, people are beginning to flee in search of freedoms, peace, and resources that are not available within their homelands. We need a new model to accommodate these shifts. In a world of borders and nation states, displaced peoples are unable to find a home neither here nor there, trusting their life to armed smugglers, floating on boats across long water highways from one coastline to another. The Social Contract In the 16th century, the idea of a Social Contract between government and citizens was introduced. Individuals would give up certain liberties to the state. In exchange, the government would provide order, protection, security, and other benefits that citizens would not be able to attain on their own. In principle this model has immense potential. A central body can establish large distribution networks, construct borders to protect citizens from outside invaders, and invest in infrastructure that small groups of citizens would not be able to build themselves. And unlike corporations or organizations that are capable of similar feats, governments or nation states work in the interest of the voting citizen. There is, theoretically, an inherent responsibility to work in the public\u2019s interest. But recently there have been several important shifts. Advancements in technology have made distribution networks and infrastructure easier to build. Refugees and migrants are increasing for a variety of reasons, including global warming. And thirdly war and violence are decreasing. These conditions create an ecosystem ripe for individuals to begin experimenting with creating their own \u201cmini societies\u201d. And at first this seems like a nice little experiment, a luxury for alternative lifestyles to prosper outside of the formal state. But when we look closer at how oppressive governments and regimes have become relative to our expectations, we realize that governments are not fulfilling their part of the social contract. They are failing their citizens and non-registered residents in monumental ways. People with disabilities are legally allowed to be paid subminimum wage. Sex workers are constantly threatened through predatory legislation. All while a host of indecipherable political jargon threatens the internet as we know it. In countries like the United States, Australia, and South Africa, prison systems continue to disproportionally incarcerate black communities for the same crimes committed by whites. It seems that the only tool that government continues to institute is the use of force to maintain order. Let us then admit that force does not create right, and that we are obliged to obey only legitimate powers - Rousseau But where are the fruits that we were promised for our liberties? We can not experiment unregulated medicines, but are also not provided adequate affordable healthcare. Our government doesn\u2019t provide living necessities and then incarcerates anyone who tries to feed themselves, their families, or find shelter in abandoned buildings. And after we have made our peace with the fact that the government is not able to provide us with what we need, we are not able to leave the country unless we go through extensive background checks and invasions of privacy. Governments have failed in providing their end of the social contract, and if we can\u2019t hold our governments accountable, what do we do? Self-Governance as Human Right Our safety, individual liberties, and freedoms are all defined by the state. We have specific inalienable rights. And yet we are not provided a path towards pursuing these liberties on our own. In fact, they are often controlled by the state from which we are unable to escape. And the more our rights are violated by the state, the less opportunity we have to pursue them. If we consider things such as life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to be inalienable, shouldn\u2019t we be able to pursue them outside the context of a state? And if the state is the main culprit of oppression, shouldn\u2019t our right to self-govern supersede all other rights? Self-governance is not a luxury, it is a human right. The movement to reframe self-governance as an inalienable human right is in its nascency. Organizations like Amnesty International and the United Nations still function on the premise of nation states, and most activists, political change makers, and human rights advocates still see the governments as not only central to their work, but the key component of change making. Identify a human rights crisis, investigate, work with lawmakers to craft legislation, and then lobby. In the coming decades we need to start considering alternative paths. Circumventing corrupt governments to provide opportunity for communities to self organize, self-govern, and start their own societies is one approach. There are, of course, caveats. We need to make freedom of migration a priority. Ties to land, resources, and geographically placed social connections keep us in societies that are not beneficial to our wellbeing. And like anything, this won\u2019t be a final solution, but the principle still holds: allow for citizens to take their inalienable rights into their own hands. Provide people with a way to circumvent the government since our governments have not been able to complete their half of the social contract. The first step to this future is to begin to see self-governance as an inalienable right of the people. If we are dissatisfied with our governing body we should be able to break away and make attempts at our own society. Building the Future In the world of distributed governance there is work being done to create the political, economic, and societal systems of tomorrow. The blockchain community is frustrated by centralization. We hate the repercussions of large corporations having control over our data, digital assets, and our bodies. And so, as engineers and entrepreneurs we want to contribute to a movement that diminishes the power of these oppressive institutions. But governments play just as much, if not a greater, role in centralization of power. Instead of controlling servers, governments control land, borders, and behavior through the mask of nation states. So the question becomes what can the blockchain community do to contribute to the human rights struggle for self-governance? Let us never forget that government is ourselves and not an alien power over us. The ultimate rulers of our democracy are not a President and senators and congressmen and government officials, but the voters of this country. -Franklin D. Roosevelt Dozens of organizations are working to bring individual sovereignty to the world\u2019s citizens. But you can\u2019t just take one approach. You need to come at this problem from several angles. There are essentially three types of governing bodies. Corporations and Organizations dictate how we interact with our economic systems. Governments provide the rules and regulations through which we receive basic necessities: housing, healthcare, education, protection. And, finally, societies provide us with rules on how to interact with one another through social norms, societal taboos, culture, and identity. These three bodies together form the foundations of our socio-political-economic world. But the influence of these spheres fluctuate which leads to immense complexity. Take the U.S. for example. We are drifting away from our societal sphere to become more dependent on corporations. The individualism that capitalism fosters brings financial opportunity, but often skirts community building. From the government perspective we see a hyperinflation of fear, which leads to the placement of taxpayer funds into only one aspect of our public programs: defense. As a result we don\u2019t provide healthcare or proper education and our homeless are pushed into the streets. Tent cities have become a facet of American infrastructure. We won\u2019t be able to implement an effective system of distributed governance unless we take a three-pronged approach, focusing on each sphere. And fortunately, that\u2019s how governance on the blockchain is evolving. Corporations and Organizations When we look at corporations and organizations we see many new blockchain startups building the infrastructure to tackle this institution. Companies like Aragon lead the way, embracing the culture and language of DAOs or Decentralized Autonomous Organizations. DAOs are entities that rely on smart contracts, pre-programmed rules that define the behavior and allowed actions within a system. For example, you can program smart contracts to carry out tasks such as releasing funds on a certain date or when a percentage of voters agree to fund a project. Essentially, DAOs are a way to cryptographically guarantee democracy. Participants are able to vote on new rules, change rules, remove members, and come to consensus on issues which can then trigger system action. No centralized control. No corrupt intermediaries. While Aragon has embraced the language of DAOs, the other organizations in the decentralized governance space are essentially building variations of this same system. Government On the government front, we see Agora working with nation states like Sierra Leone to implement blockchain based elections. Providing an electoral blockchain solution is one thing, but convincing a government that they should use this technology is another. Authoritarian regimes, technologically outdated institutions, and highly bureaucratic offices, create resistance, fear, and distrust. Sierra Leone was eager to provide \u201can environment of trust with voters in a contentious election\u201d. As the reach of the technology grows we\u2019ll see if other governments feel the same eagerness in creating freer, more transparent elections. Society Both governments and corporations already have understood structures. Both are consumers of technology and though some move more slowly then others, they understand the need to \u201csurvive\u201d by staying up-to-date. On the societal front things get a bit trickier. We\u2019re not at a point where we truly understand how collections of people work or operate. How do you deal with Tyranny of the Majority, or minority communities being shut out of the electoral process? How do you provide egalitarian meritocracy in a world that is inherently unequal and will remain so due to immense disparities in power, wealth, and stability? Do we provide more voting power to children because they will be affected by the policies we choose, or more power to experts who have a deep understanding of how social policy affects our day to day lives? These are the types of questions that surround societal governance. Organizations like Democracy Earth are working on providing governance solutions for individuals and communities to be able to break off and make attempts at building their own societies. When political or economic collapse strikes a region, citizens are affected by immense instability. Delivering food and other forms of aid is not enough. Providing the opportunity to self-govern and solutions for a \u201cgovernment in a box\u201d can help societies regain stability in the face of corrupt leadership, natural disasters, and collapsing nation states. Adapting to a Different World We\u2019re changing. Our society, our infrastructure, our understanding of our place in the universe. And with that change comes a renewed understanding of the inalienable freedoms of every living being. The constitutions of nation states have gone through countless revisions, opening up space in society for people of color, the queer community, migrants, and other members of minority groups. But a major problem still remains. Even the best examples of nation states and governments have failed to implement their utopian legislation. In addition, individual and societal prejudices, economic disparities, and unequal control over resources have left some populations with overabundance and others with a guaranteed death sentence. We need to start looking past a world organized by the ownership of land, or the ownership of server power. Past borders, centralized governments, and monopolistic corporations. At first it might seem terrifying. Allowing individuals to break off on their own, starting societies that are not under the control of a central state. But isn\u2019t the idea of a centralized authority that controls citizens through violence and force also uncomfortable? At the end of the day it comes down to implementation. Nation states need caveats, and so does self-governance. But a restriction on our inherent right to choose our own society is unproductive, and I would argue, harmful. Our world is moving towards a state of increased fluidity and flexibility. We need to embrace the human right to self-governance. Without an ability for communities to experiment, explore, and iterate on their dream societies, we won\u2019t be able to adapt to the rapidly changing state of humankind.","title":"Self-Governance as a Human Right"},{"location":"archive/issue08/articles/opinion/Self-Governance_as_a_Human_Right/#self-governance-as-a-human-right","text":"Author Marik Hazan / @marikio (Kamaria\u2019s name has been changed for her safety) She was astounded no one noticed her. White skin, dressed in all black. Rash guard, board shorts, and a burn bag with a first aid kit, water shoes, and fins. Sweating from the anxiety, Kamaria knew that the trip she\u2019d make in several hours could end in her throat being cut by smugglers, or police kidnapping her again. They were in a tourist district, not too far from the hotels. Moms held kids and rucksacks, while dads pointed cameras out the bus windows taking shots of Seljuk buildings and mustached Dondurma vendors tricking tourists into reaching for their waffle cones. A few months earlier a former Turkish military man had shown her the site where she was headed. He had done so as a joke, not thinking that she would ever end up coming back. At the time, Kamaria didn\u2019t either. It was only a while later that she realized it was the perfect spot to stand watch. Several hours after the bus had dropped her off, she headed towards the long pier, about a kilometer away from the closest hotel. She had to wait another 6 to 7 hours before the boats would start leaving port. Watching with binoculars pressed tightly to her eyes, she would count the number of boats to undock and later warn her contacts on the Greece coastline of how many refugees they should expect.","title":"Self-Governance as a Human Right"},{"location":"archive/issue08/articles/opinion/Self-Governance_as_a_Human_Right/#the-failure-of-government","text":"Political and economic collapse in Venezuela, the flood of refugees from Syria, China\u2019s transformation into a police state, and the US\u2019s failed democracy are awakening the world to the instability of government, the corruption of wealth and corporations, and the lack of freedom for societies all around the world. For thousands of years we\u2019ve been attempting to iterate on a model of governance that has failed to scale to accommodate a globalized world focused on the individual liberties of humankind. And now we\u2019re coming to terms with the consequences. Globally, people are beginning to flee in search of freedoms, peace, and resources that are not available within their homelands. We need a new model to accommodate these shifts. In a world of borders and nation states, displaced peoples are unable to find a home neither here nor there, trusting their life to armed smugglers, floating on boats across long water highways from one coastline to another.","title":"The Failure of Government"},{"location":"archive/issue08/articles/opinion/Self-Governance_as_a_Human_Right/#the-social-contract","text":"In the 16th century, the idea of a Social Contract between government and citizens was introduced. Individuals would give up certain liberties to the state. In exchange, the government would provide order, protection, security, and other benefits that citizens would not be able to attain on their own. In principle this model has immense potential. A central body can establish large distribution networks, construct borders to protect citizens from outside invaders, and invest in infrastructure that small groups of citizens would not be able to build themselves. And unlike corporations or organizations that are capable of similar feats, governments or nation states work in the interest of the voting citizen. There is, theoretically, an inherent responsibility to work in the public\u2019s interest. But recently there have been several important shifts. Advancements in technology have made distribution networks and infrastructure easier to build. Refugees and migrants are increasing for a variety of reasons, including global warming. And thirdly war and violence are decreasing. These conditions create an ecosystem ripe for individuals to begin experimenting with creating their own \u201cmini societies\u201d. And at first this seems like a nice little experiment, a luxury for alternative lifestyles to prosper outside of the formal state. But when we look closer at how oppressive governments and regimes have become relative to our expectations, we realize that governments are not fulfilling their part of the social contract. They are failing their citizens and non-registered residents in monumental ways. People with disabilities are legally allowed to be paid subminimum wage. Sex workers are constantly threatened through predatory legislation. All while a host of indecipherable political jargon threatens the internet as we know it. In countries like the United States, Australia, and South Africa, prison systems continue to disproportionally incarcerate black communities for the same crimes committed by whites. It seems that the only tool that government continues to institute is the use of force to maintain order. Let us then admit that force does not create right, and that we are obliged to obey only legitimate powers - Rousseau But where are the fruits that we were promised for our liberties? We can not experiment unregulated medicines, but are also not provided adequate affordable healthcare. Our government doesn\u2019t provide living necessities and then incarcerates anyone who tries to feed themselves, their families, or find shelter in abandoned buildings. And after we have made our peace with the fact that the government is not able to provide us with what we need, we are not able to leave the country unless we go through extensive background checks and invasions of privacy. Governments have failed in providing their end of the social contract, and if we can\u2019t hold our governments accountable, what do we do?","title":"The Social Contract"},{"location":"archive/issue08/articles/opinion/Self-Governance_as_a_Human_Right/#self-governance-as-human-right","text":"Our safety, individual liberties, and freedoms are all defined by the state. We have specific inalienable rights. And yet we are not provided a path towards pursuing these liberties on our own. In fact, they are often controlled by the state from which we are unable to escape. And the more our rights are violated by the state, the less opportunity we have to pursue them. If we consider things such as life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to be inalienable, shouldn\u2019t we be able to pursue them outside the context of a state? And if the state is the main culprit of oppression, shouldn\u2019t our right to self-govern supersede all other rights? Self-governance is not a luxury, it is a human right. The movement to reframe self-governance as an inalienable human right is in its nascency. Organizations like Amnesty International and the United Nations still function on the premise of nation states, and most activists, political change makers, and human rights advocates still see the governments as not only central to their work, but the key component of change making. Identify a human rights crisis, investigate, work with lawmakers to craft legislation, and then lobby. In the coming decades we need to start considering alternative paths. Circumventing corrupt governments to provide opportunity for communities to self organize, self-govern, and start their own societies is one approach. There are, of course, caveats. We need to make freedom of migration a priority. Ties to land, resources, and geographically placed social connections keep us in societies that are not beneficial to our wellbeing. And like anything, this won\u2019t be a final solution, but the principle still holds: allow for citizens to take their inalienable rights into their own hands. Provide people with a way to circumvent the government since our governments have not been able to complete their half of the social contract. The first step to this future is to begin to see self-governance as an inalienable right of the people. If we are dissatisfied with our governing body we should be able to break away and make attempts at our own society.","title":"Self-Governance as Human Right"},{"location":"archive/issue08/articles/opinion/Self-Governance_as_a_Human_Right/#building-the-future","text":"In the world of distributed governance there is work being done to create the political, economic, and societal systems of tomorrow. The blockchain community is frustrated by centralization. We hate the repercussions of large corporations having control over our data, digital assets, and our bodies. And so, as engineers and entrepreneurs we want to contribute to a movement that diminishes the power of these oppressive institutions. But governments play just as much, if not a greater, role in centralization of power. Instead of controlling servers, governments control land, borders, and behavior through the mask of nation states. So the question becomes what can the blockchain community do to contribute to the human rights struggle for self-governance? Let us never forget that government is ourselves and not an alien power over us. The ultimate rulers of our democracy are not a President and senators and congressmen and government officials, but the voters of this country. -Franklin D. Roosevelt Dozens of organizations are working to bring individual sovereignty to the world\u2019s citizens. But you can\u2019t just take one approach. You need to come at this problem from several angles. There are essentially three types of governing bodies. Corporations and Organizations dictate how we interact with our economic systems. Governments provide the rules and regulations through which we receive basic necessities: housing, healthcare, education, protection. And, finally, societies provide us with rules on how to interact with one another through social norms, societal taboos, culture, and identity. These three bodies together form the foundations of our socio-political-economic world. But the influence of these spheres fluctuate which leads to immense complexity. Take the U.S. for example. We are drifting away from our societal sphere to become more dependent on corporations. The individualism that capitalism fosters brings financial opportunity, but often skirts community building. From the government perspective we see a hyperinflation of fear, which leads to the placement of taxpayer funds into only one aspect of our public programs: defense. As a result we don\u2019t provide healthcare or proper education and our homeless are pushed into the streets. Tent cities have become a facet of American infrastructure. We won\u2019t be able to implement an effective system of distributed governance unless we take a three-pronged approach, focusing on each sphere. And fortunately, that\u2019s how governance on the blockchain is evolving. Corporations and Organizations When we look at corporations and organizations we see many new blockchain startups building the infrastructure to tackle this institution. Companies like Aragon lead the way, embracing the culture and language of DAOs or Decentralized Autonomous Organizations. DAOs are entities that rely on smart contracts, pre-programmed rules that define the behavior and allowed actions within a system. For example, you can program smart contracts to carry out tasks such as releasing funds on a certain date or when a percentage of voters agree to fund a project. Essentially, DAOs are a way to cryptographically guarantee democracy. Participants are able to vote on new rules, change rules, remove members, and come to consensus on issues which can then trigger system action. No centralized control. No corrupt intermediaries. While Aragon has embraced the language of DAOs, the other organizations in the decentralized governance space are essentially building variations of this same system. Government On the government front, we see Agora working with nation states like Sierra Leone to implement blockchain based elections. Providing an electoral blockchain solution is one thing, but convincing a government that they should use this technology is another. Authoritarian regimes, technologically outdated institutions, and highly bureaucratic offices, create resistance, fear, and distrust. Sierra Leone was eager to provide \u201can environment of trust with voters in a contentious election\u201d. As the reach of the technology grows we\u2019ll see if other governments feel the same eagerness in creating freer, more transparent elections. Society Both governments and corporations already have understood structures. Both are consumers of technology and though some move more slowly then others, they understand the need to \u201csurvive\u201d by staying up-to-date. On the societal front things get a bit trickier. We\u2019re not at a point where we truly understand how collections of people work or operate. How do you deal with Tyranny of the Majority, or minority communities being shut out of the electoral process? How do you provide egalitarian meritocracy in a world that is inherently unequal and will remain so due to immense disparities in power, wealth, and stability? Do we provide more voting power to children because they will be affected by the policies we choose, or more power to experts who have a deep understanding of how social policy affects our day to day lives? These are the types of questions that surround societal governance. Organizations like Democracy Earth are working on providing governance solutions for individuals and communities to be able to break off and make attempts at building their own societies. When political or economic collapse strikes a region, citizens are affected by immense instability. Delivering food and other forms of aid is not enough.

Davis III / @csggene3 The last two years have seen a precipitous rise and fall in the both the price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum amongst many new others branded as ICOs (or initial coin offerings) as well as a general awareness of their existence and the broader underlying ecosystems that accompany them.

There are hundreds of similar projects like these with similar accusations against their progenitors and \"developers,\" or dismissed as \" honest failures due to diminished market conditions,\" yet these types of blatant excuses fall on the deaf ears of the thousands that lost out and the many other honest developers that knew better. Back in July of 2014, Vitalik Buterin, the brain child behind Ethereum, led a crowdsale issuing 2000 ETH for each 1 BTC valued at around $600/BTC at the time, and raised 3700 BTC in the course of 12 hours, raising about $2.3 million USD in that time period setting the stage for a grand capitalization project. I highlight the Ethereum crowdsale to bring attention to the point of this article, the DAO (or decentralized autonomous organization) and the first effort at such an organizational structure and concept. \"TheDAO,\" as it is now infamously known, began raising capital in May of 2016 and quickly reached the dizzying heights of $150 million USD within that single month from just 11,000 investors. Ethereum's power is in the ability to drive \"smart contracts\" that function through the blockchain-based virtual machine Buterin envisioned as the perfect compliment to Bitcoin. Bitcoin is essentially a store of value, likened by Buterin to gold whereas he likens Ethereum to oil, providing energy to the \"smart contracts.\" The DAO is essentially a special form of smart contract that creates a virtual organization, providing a predefined function or set of functions without the need to employ a large-scale permanent staff to receive or distribute funds, removing the conflict of trust and significantly reducing operational overhead. Though a DAO can operate as a profitable venture, the majority of current DAOs serve charitable functions such as decentralized governance, poverty reduction, and other \"broader good\" purposes that can make up the backbone of the evolving blockchain ecosystem. Getting back to the case of the original \"TheDAO,\" a small programming error in the smart contract allowed for a significant amount of the funds to be stolen by an unknown hacker or group of hackers. Usually in the case of cryptocurrency, stolen funds on a blockchain cannot be reversed and are then in essence gone permanently without recourse, but in certain situations if enough holders vote to \"hardfork\" the currency or the contract, the stolen funds can be stranded in a way that keeps them from being spendable or withdrawn. The Ethereum community discussed their options and decided to hardfork the token, leading to a split in the blockchain and creating 2 currencies, Ethereum and Ethereum Classic, while disabling the hacker as well. A heroic band of developers comprised of some of the original smart contract writing members who created the bug, called themselves WHG, or the White Hat Group, and were led by Griff Green to be able to review the original code, patch the errors, and begin to recover the stolen funds by creating some new smaller contracts that would help users recover what they lost individually. This was a black spot on the record of Ethereum and the DAO concept in general, but demonstrated valuable lessons that could be learned and worked out worst case scenarios with functional solutions offered, drastic though they might have been. Griff Green has gone on to found a truly remarkable new DAO called Giveth that focuses on building the infrastructure to enable charitable purposes of all shapes and sizes. \"Blockchain4Good\" is their mantra, and they have over a dozen different Communities and Campaigns that look to make an impact serving any social good imaginable, with more in the pipeline and anyone with the desire eligible to create their own. Aragon is another one of their DACs (or Decentralized Altruistic Communities) that focuses on providing social benefit through novel concepts and coordination with like minded developers that want to make a difference in the world without sacrificing their principles to work for a prototypical corporate overlord. Doing charitable work doesn't necessarily mean working for free, and these organizations have already received grants while continuing to be eligible for funding from larger organizations like the Ethereum Foundation as well as none blockchain based corporations and organizations like banks, the UN, and UNICEF. The true power of the DAO lies in replacing the traditional infrastructure of charitable foundations and non-profit corporations around the world, as well as potentially government legislative bodies and voting or election mechanisms. Let's start with the non-profit corporation. Many think that non-profits are judged primarily by the social good they intend to do, like curing cancer, ending human trafficking, or saving the rain forests. While this metric is noble in and of itself, it does little to complete the broader picture of how well they accomplish these goals. Cancer still isn't cured, human trafficking still exists, and the rain forests are still burning. The truest measure of how well a non-profit accomplishes its stated purpose is to look at the proportion of donations they receive each year to their spending on maintaining their own existence, commonly referred to as overhead. Many ostensibly well meaning organizations spend a giant portion of their yearly donations in a wasteful, and none transparent manner, with very large non-profits very commonly spending more than 50% yearly on staff salaries, office spaces, office equipment, and even luxuries that are completely disconnected from their mission statement. While there are many good organizations that do a good job of benefiting the public, there are no organizations that spend nothing on expenses. There are many websites that track this spending, and some perform better than others, but this is where the DAO structure outperforms the potential of any organizational body. As long as the software is in place, funds can be placed within the smart contract, and their intended use can be dedicated to the stated purpose, in a trust free fashion, with no overhead to speak of. Charitable funds can be dispensed to their intended targets through crypto currency wallets without the need for money to change hands. Items can be purchased and shipped to whomever and wherever they are needed without the need for a middleman. Donations can be accumulated, tracked in a central location, and followed to their end use point without requiring the trust or touch of a human being at any point. Decentralized governance is also on the horizon with these same structures. Tokens can serve as voting rights or weight of votes, replacing the need for polling station, physically counting ballots, or trusting the integrity of the people involved. Campaign finance issues can be heavily curbed by removing the need for all that overhead and limiting the distribution of information to those known to hold the token voting rights, removing the need for shotgun style political or legislative advertising. Trust of government systems and legislative bodies can be restored by replacing human beings whose only purpose is to cast a vote with a trust free model that takes its direction from a smart contract that can be relied upon to do exactly what it is supposed to, is available all day, everyday, and is never swayed by money, favors, or other forms of untoward political influence. Politicians, campaign finance, physical infrastructure, and other forms of needless spending can be done away with in favor of a transparent model that has little to no overhead, and can be trusted to do exactly what the code says it will do, every time. The DAO is the solution to almost every organizational challenge society faces today. The monies that could be cumulatively dedicated to DAO versions of the world's current organizations would perform so much more good than presently possible, the positive results are almost inconceivable. The potential to convert beings to code and allow the DAO to perform their job more efficiently and in a trust free manner will change the world. If we are honest with ourselves and each other, we should strive to understand these opportunities and implement them in our own communities and with our own ideas as soon as humanly possible.","title":"ICOs for Fraud DAOs for function"},{"location":"articles/opinion/ICOs_For_Fraud-DAOs-For_Function/#icos-are-for-fraud-daos-are-for-function","text":"A comparison between the ICO and DAO concepts Author C.E.

From a technical perspective, this ensures that we do not have a single point of failure, facilitate open community development and higher reliability. In my first month as an intern at ConsenSys, it has become clear to me that the structure of the company closely resembles that of a blockchain system, which is coincidental because that\u2019s what we\u2019re all working so hard to build and grow here. I've been thinking a lot about what motivates those of us BUIDLing blockchain products. Three types of motivation keep emerging in my consciousness and daily experience. Each type has its own attractions and difficulties. This post will explain my perspective on the three.

For some of you who are not familiar with our projects, you can learn more about us and the Aragon Nest program here. So without further ado, here is what we have been up to during the month of August. In this article, I\u2019m going to be deep diving into Chainlink. From giving the problem it\u2019s aiming to solve; the solution they\u2019re currently developing for that problem and my own deep-dive into the technology they\u2019ve built so far. Token Curated Registries (TCRs) are an idea that gained a fair amount of traction within the cryptocurrency community throughout late 2017 and early 2018. While the idea has yet to be implemented at any meaningful scale, there are a few TCRs live on the Ethereum mainnet and over a dozen projects are considering building TCRs in some form.

This is Aragon and we are coming to ETHBerlin, Berlin! We are so excited, so happy, really so thrilled to be Tier 5 \u2013 The Carlos Matos sponsor of the hackathon. Our mentors are coming, and they are coming in waves! Let me tell you, that we started 92 days ago with only one goal in mind. And right now, we are reaching that goal of being a part of the astonishing and inspiring ETHBerlin hackathon. And let me tell you that we are now actually putting two distinct bounty tracks up for hackers to #buidl on during the hackathon! The first one on our Aragon Nest Team Interviews is That Planning Suite who are working on an open source incentivization app. With this series, we want to bring forth the teams that have received a grant and funding from the Aragon Nest grants program. That Planning Suite was the first team accepted into the program and we're all thrilled to see their suite of apps becoming a part of the Aragon ecosystem. In their new paper Vitalik Buterin, Zoe Hitzig, and E. Glen Weyl propose a mechanism for a more efficient allocation of resources towards public goods. The mechanism, called Liberal Radical (LR), seeks to create \u201cformal rules for a society neutral among communities\u201d. Which essentially means a way for a society to deploy collective resources towards public goods while remaining neutral with regard to its constituents often competing preferences.

There\u2019s a lot of confusion about blockchain governance. Many participants and potential participants inside and outside the blockchain space fail to effectively participate in blockchain governance. I hope that this situation will improve with more public understanding of the basics of blockchain governance, the possible governance outcomes, and how they can most effectively participate in blockchain governance.
