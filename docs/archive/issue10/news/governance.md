If you follow me on Twitter, you know that I spend a lot of time thinking about governance. It is a topic that is misunderstood by both investors and makers in the space, and for those who understand it, there are still the questions of (1) what is good governance and (2) how do you properly value it. Because of these challenges, I predict that we will look back on governance in a few years as an obvious investable trend that many crypto investors missed on. For today’s post, I picked out some of my favorite articles that I would recommend reading if you’re looking to get smart on the subject. |

Through this wave of adoption, an increasing amount of financial value will be tied to their respective blockchains (in this paper, the term ‘blockchain’ is used as a blanket term for DLTs and focuses more on decentralised public blockchains). As these blockchains increasingly facilitates more financial and economic activity, engineering decisions and policy will naturally present financial and social consequences to organisations that hold vested interests in them. While consensus mechanisms enable data data availability, validity and cannocality, the democratic governance of the technology itself will come under strain as an increasingly pool of stakeholders vie for their own agendas. In spite of the innovative that are blockchains, they are meaningless if the ageless problem of governance is not solved or at least given greater attention. | Our white paper brings to light a vision for a token based platform built on Ethereum called adChain. The idea behind it was to give people from around the world the ability to curate a single list of digital publishers so that advertisers could use it as a public utility. | Hi, this is Peter Zeitz, research fellow on the 0x core team. Formerly, I was an assistant professor of economics at the National University of Singapore Business School and prior to that a post-doctoral fellow at Stanford, where I arrived after earning an Economics PhD from UCLA. [...] I am now delighted to begin sharing some of my research on governance with the broader 0x community. In this essay, I focus on how the extent of horizontal competition and the assignment of project ownership rights affects the incentives of blockchain development teams to collaborate. The essay may be a bit long and dry, but if you are interested in a deep dive into blockchain governance I think you’ll find the content interesting. In parallel with this work, I have been working on plans to operationalize decentralized governance systems at 0x. In the next couple of weeks, I will provide some details on our plans to utilize a community grant program to implement experiments with decentralized governance. Some of our emerging governance ideas are still too preliminary to release to the public, but in the coming months I expect that we will have a lot of exciting work to disclose. |

When it comes to innovation in the structure of government, few topics have generated as much conversation in the last decade as charter cities. The debate kicked off with economist Paul Romer’s famous TED talk in 2009, which presented the idea to a mass audience. Advocates noted two key obstacles in economically developing countries: the lack of stable and trustworthy institutions and the lack of strategies to reform existing ones. Romer and others noticed that a proven strategy was the use of small autonomous regions which could test reforms that might spur investment and later expand to the rest of the country. Prominently cited are the special administrative regions (SAR) and special economic zones (SEZ) used by China during its reform period. The regions of Dubai and Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates are also common examples. | This piece offers some guidance through a series of discrete reflections on the relationship between Crypto & international law. This is a long read (and it was a long “write”), but the time invested will be amply repaid. **Thesis:** International Law (IL) isn’t just one potential future blockchain governance outcome; IL is today’s and tomorrow’s actual governance reality. The bigger question is how open these international legal blockchain governance processes are, should be, and will be. | This post is in response to Vlad Zamfir’s recent posts on blockchain governance which describe what he believes are likely outcomes and which of those outcomes he intends to support. If you haven’t already read them I suggest starting there first. In this post I will explain why I advocate for autonomous blockchain goverance. |

If 2017 was a year when fundraising for decentralized protocols dominated headlines, 2018’s emerging narrative is about empowering investors. From fits and starts on ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake to Tezos’ launch, governance has been one of the persistent conversations in crypto this year. But for all the promise, one long awaited approach to blockchain governance, Decred’s Politeia software, went live today at 1300 UTC. | At a high level, blockchain governance refers to the mechanisms by which decentralized networks adapt and change over time. While blockchain networks should be intelligently designed, it’s only natural that new considerations are uncovered once a protocol has been tested by the public. | **An intro to the principles of governance.** Every collective action whether it is a small group or a vast nation-state follows a governance process. Sometimes this process is formalized, well-documented, and rigid. Other times it is so fluid and informal that it is difficult to observe. The purpose of this post is not to prescribe or analyze any specific process or method for governing, as governance is contextual. |
