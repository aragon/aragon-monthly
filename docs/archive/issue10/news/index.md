We released Aragon 0.5 seven months ago. Since then, more than 2,500 organizations have been created with it. Counting all Aragon versions, the total number of Aragon organizations now adds up to 15,000+. That's more than the number of businesses created yearly in Austria, Malta and Luxembourg combined. Decentralized organizations are here to stay. Yet all those organizations were running on Ethereum testnets, with no real world implications. **Today, that changes.**|

If you follow me on Twitter, you know that I spend a lot of time thinking about governance. It is a topic that is misunderstood by both investors and makers in the space, and for those who understand it, there are still the questions of (1) what is good governance and (2) how do you properly value it. Because of these challenges, I predict that we will look back on governance in a few years as an obvious investable trend that many crypto investors missed on. For today’s post, I picked out some of my favorite articles that I would recommend reading if you’re looking to get smart on the subject. | This paper proposes best practices for “Smartdrops”, as a means of fast-tracking community growth, raising brand awareness and incentivizing early adopters that are highly aligned with the values of your project. Intelligently targeting the recipients of an airdrop and giving away a meaningful amount of value provides large benefits to your project, primarily: increased network effect and allowing many new users to access your technology.| This article explores the practical use of token bonding curves and curation markets to fund, curate and distribute ownership of intellectual property. In short, Token Curated Intellectual Property. The goal of the proposed design mechanism is to distribute risk, reward and ownership of intellectual assets and enable market participants to make early research and development stages liquid and tradable. This could have a wide range of applications in scientific development, pharmaceuticals, software development and engineering.|

Bonding curves are essentially a mechanism that allows the continual liquidity of a token, with the price changing depending on how much ‘activity’ is conducted. Most use cases are for buying and selling into the curve, e.g. the more people that buy tokens, the higher the price goes up, the less people that buy tokens, the lower the price goes. | Recently, a number of proposals and applications have evolved on Ethereum that require voting; from contracts that use voting-based DAOs for governance or other administrative tasks, to boardroom-like votes to proposals for open source funding. Voting appears to be a natural target for Ethereum and applications. Unfortunately, the space of voting algorithms opens a new class of buying and bribery coordination mechanisms that could prove devastating in permissionless networks, either as credible threats or as actual deployed threats. Some schemes, even ones which assume robust identity, may be even more vulnerable than naive schemes 11. | Decentralized exchanges are likely the best price-finding solution for futarchy markets but, until they’ve achieved sufficient usability and liquidity, futarchies must be self contained providing their own price-finding mechanism. The current best know solution is to use an LMSR automated market maker but this presents a significant challenge. Each LMSR market must be funded up front in order to provide liquidity to market participants. This places a significant burden on the party that needs to provide the funding. |

Through this wave of adoption, an increasing amount of financial value will be tied to their respective blockchains (in this paper, the term ‘blockchain’ is used as a blanket term for DLTs and focuses more on decentralised public blockchains). As these blockchains increasingly facilitates more financial and economic activity, engineering decisions and policy will naturally present financial and social consequences to organisations that hold vested interests in them. While consensus mechanisms enable data data availability, validity and cannocality, the democratic governance of the technology itself will come under strain as an increasingly pool of stakeholders vie for their own agendas. In spite of the innovative that are blockchains, they are meaningless if the ageless problem of governance is not solved or at least given greater attention. | What does moving toward a DAO mean for you as a contributor to Status, what are the different ways to get involved and how does what you do at Status change? The problem with writing about new stuff is that it's very hard not to use jargon which ends up intimidating everyone and distracting them from the real intention around experimenting with different kinds of services, organisation, and speech. I don't want to rehash the history of The DAO for you, and I don't want to make a rhetorical argument about how broken governance is in the world; whether that refers to corporations and regulation, or to the various flavours of state-based government practiced across the world today. | Our white paper brings to light a vision for a token based platform built on Ethereum called adChain. The idea behind it was to give people from around the world the ability to curate a single list of digital publishers so that advertisers could use it as a public utility. |

Hi, this is Peter Zeitz, research fellow on the 0x core team. Formerly, I was an assistant professor of economics at the National University of Singapore Business School and prior to that a post-doctoral fellow at Stanford, where I arrived after earning an Economics PhD from UCLA. [...] I am now delighted to begin sharing some of my research on governance with the broader 0x community. In this essay, I focus on how the extent of horizontal competition and the assignment of project ownership rights affects the incentives of blockchain development teams to collaborate. The essay may be a bit long and dry, but if you are interested in a deep dive into blockchain governance I think you’ll find the content interesting. In parallel with this work, I have been working on plans to operationalize decentralized governance systems at 0x. In the next couple of weeks, I will provide some details on our plans to utilize a community grant program to implement experiments with decentralized governance. Some of our emerging governance ideas are still too preliminary to release to the public, but in the coming months I expect that we will have a lot of exciting work to disclose. | The two cardinal problems facing smart contract-enabled blockchains today, in order of importance, are 1) scaling and 2) oracles. The former problem is well-known and highly-advertised by almost everyone in the blockchain ecosystem, but the latter is seldom discussed. Scaling (i.e. increasing transaction throughput) makes blockchains usable while oracles make blockchains useful. | Hey - quite a while ago @vbuterin suggested a bunch of crypto economic experiments [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/453sid/empirical_cryptoeconomics/). We (Gnosis) are since a long time interested in providing the tools for projects to use Futarchy for decision making. Thus we have been naturally interested in those experiments around market manipulation. Long story short - we are now ready to start those experiments and are looking for people to participate. While in principal those experiments are open and anyone can participate we nevertheless want to have an active core group to make sure it makes sense to start them. |

AraCon – The first Aragon Conference - will take place in **Berlin, Germany on January 29th-30th 2019**. The conference will bring together people who embody and wish to shape the Aragon community. Those who are building and supporting the pseudonymous, secure, trustless future — the decentralized web. Decentralized governance and DAOs are at the heart of the new Web 3.0. They are key components in moving towards a more fair and open world for everyone. | When it comes to innovation in the structure of government, few topics have generated as much conversation in the last decade as charter cities. The debate kicked off with economist Paul Romer’s famous TED talk in 2009, which presented the idea to a mass audience. Advocates noted two key obstacles in economically developing countries: the lack of stable and trustworthy institutions and the lack of strategies to reform existing ones. Romer and others noticed that a proven strategy was the use of small autonomous regions which could test reforms that might spur investment and later expand to the rest of the country. Prominently cited are the special administrative regions (SAR) and special economic zones (SEZ) used by China during its reform period. The regions of Dubai and Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates are also common examples. | We are Prysmatic Labs, a team of driven open source developers working to improve scalability for Ethereum 2.0. Our project, Prysm, is a new sharding and Casper compatible client for Ethereum. Our team met organically at the right time and the right place. We were all interested in protocol development and were wondering why no one was working on an implementation of the Sharding FAQ created by Vitalik near the end of last year. Preston and I were the first to connect, we established a team, and started hacking through an open source repo and public Gitter channel. Our team aims to be a big proponent of advancing the state of the art of Ethereum through good code, good documentation, and setting the example for future open source initiatives. The key point is to keep the momentum going, identify everyone’s unique strengths, and ensure we are all working on something we individually enjoy while being pragmatic with what we build. |

This piece offers some guidance through a series of discrete reflections on the relationship between Crypto & international law. This is a long read (and it was a long “write”), but the time invested will be amply repaid. **Thesis:** International Law (IL) isn’t just one potential future blockchain governance outcome; IL is today’s and tomorrow’s actual governance reality. The bigger question is how open these international legal blockchain governance processes are, should be, and will be. | This post is in response to Vlad Zamfir’s recent posts on blockchain governance which describe what he believes are likely outcomes and which of those outcomes he intends to support. If you haven’t already read them I suggest starting there first. In this post I will explain why I advocate for autonomous blockchain goverance. | The Nest program has been up and running for 7 months already. It's mature enough to make a high level analysis of the program so far and talk a bit about its future. Nest is the grants program run by the Aragon Association (formerly the Aragon Foundation). The process is public and transparent. The Aragon One team was the only team managing it and deciding who and what gets funded up until now. Currently, the Aragon DAC, the new Aragon team, is also participating in the application process. The idea is that all the different Aragon teams will have a part to play in this grants program. |

If 2017 was a year when fundraising for decentralized protocols dominated headlines, 2018’s emerging narrative is about empowering investors. From fits and starts on ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake to Tezos’ launch, governance has been one of the persistent conversations in crypto this year. But for all the promise, one long awaited approach to blockchain governance, Decred’s Politeia software, went live today at 1300 UTC. | Existing test organizations deployed on Rinkeby to be deprecated after Oct. 28th. Since the launch of Aragon Core v0.5 on the Rinkeby testnet this March, the Aragon One development team has been continually improving and battle testing the smart contracts that form the bedrock of over 2500 test organizations. However, as we progress toward a Mainnet launch, it's time to start bringing the latest technology to decentralized organizations. | At a high level, blockchain governance refers to the mechanisms by which decentralized networks adapt and change over time. While blockchain networks should be intelligently designed, it’s only natural that new considerations are uncovered once a protocol has been tested by the public. |

If Austrian economics is the theoretical foundation for Bitcoin, I think Ronald Coase is the inspiration for general cryptonetworks. In 1937, Coase wrote a seminal paper titled “The Nature of the Firm”. It laid the groundwork for a whole new branch of microeconomics, called the theory of the firm, and won the 1991 Nobel Prize. The mark of geniuses, in social sciences at least, is their ability to uncover important hidden truths that are so self-evident in hindsight. And Coase is one of these geniuses. | **An intro to the principles of governance.** Every collective action whether it is a small group or a vast nation-state follows a governance process. Sometimes this process is formalized, well-documented, and rigid. Other times it is so fluid and informal that it is difficult to observe. The purpose of this post is not to prescribe or analyze any specific process or method for governing, as governance is contextual. | Five new teams have been awarded grants with funding from the Aragon Project. The Nest grants program has introduced rounds one and two with the first teams. We now have five more teams that have been granted funding by the Aragon Project. |
