Today we are releasing an entirely new step for community members to signal their sentiment on the project and igniting the next level of participation in the project for all ANT holders. Survey app is the fourth app developed by our team in addition to the Token Manager, Voting & Finance apps seen previously in Aragon Core v0.5. And the first one to launch on the Ethereum Mainnet. |

|We caught up with one of the co-founders and company CTO Jorge Izquierdo at the Shanghai Ethereum Meetup to talk about his project and the recent developments they’ve had as they move into their next version of the software, v0.5.|We have previously shared plans to transform the Aragon project to a community governed project.

Our fear is that without a global, conscious, and concerted effort, the outlook is incredibly bleak.|
