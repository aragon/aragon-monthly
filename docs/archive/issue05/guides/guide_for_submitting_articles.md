# Guide for submitting Articles

## Submitting Articles
> The pages in Aragon Monthly are static generated pages which are generated from `.md` aka MarkDown files submitted in the `aragon-monthly` repository.  
> All submissions must conform to this structure in a MarkDown format

- **Use the [basic template](#basic-article-template) as a basis for your submission.**
- **Input all the required information, if there is an image associated, add it to the `images` directory**
    - _The `index.md` will be compiled by the Editors at the end of the month from the articles submitted_
- If you don't know where each file should go, see the [repository structure](repository_structure.md) for guidance
