# Guide for submitting a [new Pull Request](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-monthly/pulls)

- Check existing [Pull Requests](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-monthly/pulls/) in the `aragon-monthly` [GitHub repository](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-monthly) to make sure that there isn't already an existing Pull Request for your content
    - _All Pull Requests need to always have the `Closes #X` so you can check if someone has submitted a Pull Request for a specific Issue by looking at the entries in the that Issue_
- Fill out the Pull Request with all the relevant information following the [new Pull Request template](new_pull_request_template.md)
    - _If you don't know where each file should go, see the [repository structure](repository_structure.md) for guidance_
- Submit the new Pull Request and participate in the discussion on that PR
