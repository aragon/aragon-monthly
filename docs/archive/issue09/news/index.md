| One of the great promises of blockchain and ethereum is decentralization. From a technical perspective, this ensures that we do not have a single point of failure, facilitate open community development and higher reliability. | In my first month as an intern at ConsenSys, it has become clear to me that the structure of the company closely resembles that of a blockchain system, which is coincidental because that’s what we’re all working so hard to build and grow here. | I've been thinking a lot about what motivates those of us BUIDLing blockchain products. Three types of motivation keep emerging in my consciousness and daily experience. Each type has its own attractions and difficulties. This post will explain my perspective on the three.

| **Halfway Through Our First Milestone!** We’ve been working hard on the Datastore and Drive App for the last four weeks and since our first sprint just ended a couple days ago, we thought it would be a good time to post our first Espresso Team update! For some of you who are not familiar with our projects, you can learn more about us and the Aragon Nest program here. So without further ado, here is what we have been up to during the month of August. | In this article, I’m going to be deep diving into Chainlink. From giving the problem it’s aiming to solve; the solution they’re currently developing for that problem and my own deep-dive into the technology they’ve built so far. | Token Curated Registries (TCRs) are an idea that gained a fair amount of traction within the cryptocurrency community throughout late 2017 and early 2018. While the idea has yet to be implemented at any meaningful scale, there are a few TCRs live on the Ethereum mainnet and over a dozen projects are considering building TCRs in some form.

| **Hey, hey, heeey! This is Aragon and we are coming to ETHBerlin, Berlin!** We are so excited, so happy, really so thrilled to be Tier 5 – The Carlos Matos sponsor of the hackathon. Our mentors are coming, and they are coming in waves! Let me tell you, that we started 92 days ago with only one goal in mind. And right now, we are reaching that goal of being a part of the astonishing and inspiring ETHBerlin hackathon. And let me tell you that we are now actually putting two distinct bounty tracks up for hackers to #buidl on during the hackathon! | **The first one on our Aragon Nest Team Interviews is That Planning Suite who are working on an open source incentivization app.** With this series, we want to bring forth the teams that have received a grant and funding from the Aragon Nest grants program. That Planning Suite was the first team accepted into the program and we're all thrilled to see their suite of apps becoming a part of the Aragon ecosystem.| In their new paper Vitalik Buterin, Zoe Hitzig, and E. Glen Weyl propose a mechanism for a more efficient allocation of resources towards public goods. The mechanism, called Liberal Radical (LR), seeks to create “formal rules for a society neutral among communities”. Which essentially means a way for a society to deploy collective resources towards public goods while remaining neutral with regard to its constituents often competing preferences.

| **APM stands for Aragon Package Manager.** The summary is that APM is a decentralized package manager. APM handles the upgradability of smart contracts as well as arbitrary data blobs. | **Welcome to the first Aragon community update!** We’ve had a lot going on in the foreground and background of the community since I first joined as Community Lead last year and I’m excited to share some of what we’ve been up to. | There’s a lot of confusion about blockchain governance. Many participants and potential participants inside and outside the blockchain space fail to effectively participate in blockchain governance. I hope that this situation will improve with more public understanding of the basics of blockchain governance, the possible governance outcomes, and how they can most effectively participate in blockchain governance.
