**Premises, Promises, and Reality.** There is a massive divide between the promises of cryptocurrency and the use cases they currently support. Most skeptics point out reasonably that there’s little to show regarding real adoption. At the same time, people in industry argue that they need time to finish the infrastructure before they can deliver game changing apps. And the tribalism clouding the topic doesn’t help. There is room for dialogue that would benefit both sides. |

**Ethereum, the second-biggest cryptocurrency in the world, has great potential as a platform for autonomous applications.** It facilitates the transfer of its cryptocurrency, can support decentralised applications, and runs smart contracts. Smart contracts run on its blockchain and are the building blocks for ambitious projects, including games like CryptoKitties. To see what lies ahead for Ethereum, MyBroadband spoke to Ethereum developer Nick Johnson about the implications of decentralised organisations.| This post is a continuation of part 1, which provided an introduction to blockchain race conditions, front-running, the 0x protocol specification and presented two ways that 0x protocol may be used to implement a decentralized exchange that eliminates front-running and trade collisions by setting the 0x order schema’s taker parameter to an externally owned account (EOA). | **Premises, Promises, and Reality.** There is a massive divide between the promises of cryptocurrency and the use cases they currently support. Most skeptics point out reasonably that there’s little to show regarding real adoption.

Without regulation, it is hard to avoid the abuse of a commons: whether it is water, a pasture or a forest. Even with regulation from governments there are still externalities that exist that are tough to enforce: eg, global regulation is hard, some commons are out of reach of regulation, some commons regulation could still be abused through corruption & some externalities are simply never catered for due to the cost in coordination. Instead of trying to force actors to curb the inevitable abuse of a commons, one could instead make it profitable to protect it. | We owe corporations credit for much of the last century’s growth and advancement. The profit-motivated and legally-backed corporation operating in a free market is the latest and greatest innovation in how humans cooperate to create things of value. Great corporations constantly reallocate resources to solve problems, and in the process provide for employees and improve products for the public. Amazon brings packages to your front door in two days, Trader Joe’s sells healthy food at an affordable price, and Google organizes information for anyone to consume. | |
