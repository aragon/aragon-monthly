Abraham Lincoln famously said that “government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth,” but looking around these days, you would be forgiven if you thought representative democracy had already been buried alongside Washington, Jefferson, and Roosevelt. Confidence in Congress remains pitifully low, driven by perceived low ethical standards and an increasing awareness that politics is bought by the highest bidder.

**What are Bonding Curves?** This is a technical primer on how to make your own bonding curves, followed by a discussion about the opportunities and risks involved. If you’re not interested in the tech, skip to the end for some general insights. If you just want some code samples in solidity, the reference github repo is [here](https://github.com/relevant-community/contracts/tree/bondingCurves/contracts) | Our first full Conspiratus episode where we discuss protocol governance with our two guests, Vlad Zamfir and Arthur Breitman.  Check out the associated reading list for this episode [here](https://conspirat.us/podcast-resources-1-protocol-governance-300fac63ffa9) | Today it is with great excitement that the Ocean Protocol team announces the release of the Ocean Protocol Technical Whitepaper! Ocean Protocol is a labor of love, blood, sweat, and tears. It encompasses the cumulative knowledge of multiple teams across multiple domains across multiple regions. It is a schelling point, influenced by tangible proficiency in diverse areas of expertise including data ecosystem architecture, blockchain implementation, cryptographic design, token mechanics, marketplace dynamics, game theory, and scalable, best-of-breed solution delivery. It is a framework that brings together services and capabilities to unlock data for AI. |

An example of a list that could eventually become a TCR :) | Abraham Lincoln famously said that “government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth,” but looking around these days, you would be forgiven if you thought representative democracy had already been buried alongside Washington, Jefferson, and Roosevelt. Confidence in Congress remains pitifully low, driven by perceived low ethical standards and an increasing awareness that politics is bought by the highest bidder. | _Greg Colvin and I would like to invite the community to come together and participate in improving the Ethereum improvement process (and so much more)._ We propose to create a Fellowship within which the Ethereum community can self-organize to maximize technical opportunities, share ideas and work together effectively, online and in person, across national, organizational and other boundaries |
