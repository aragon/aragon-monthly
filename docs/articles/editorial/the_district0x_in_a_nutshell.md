The district0x project is building a general purpose framework of smart contracts and front end libraries for the purpose of deploying, operating, and governing communal marketplaces.The network is powered by Ethereum smart contracts, ‘Aragon’ governance and the distributed file system ‘IPFS’.

The community has asked for a simple breakdown of the district0x network and the following post is based on this community feedback. Let’s dive in…

## Our Vision
Everything we’re building is to challenge the current ownership structures of our world’s communities and marketplaces. We work together everyday to lower the bar of entry so anyone can do this as well.

We believe there is a better world within grasp and we value the visions of the people that think differently about our future. With each new partnership and community member we’re building a network effect that will move us forward to these shared goals.

How Will We Achieve This?
With each development, we’re progressively building what we call d0xINFRA, a standard framework that will power the underlying network. We’re building d0xINFRA by utilizing already established curation market models like a ‘Token Curated Registry’ within our District Registry, utilizing distributed marketplace concepts (Uber, Upwork, and Airb&b) and allowing for open modular governance models by using Aragon.

Each district we launch will be a core component of d0xINFRA:

- Ethlance - Search, filtering, posting, listing, ranking and reputation
- Name Bazaar - Core framework/contracts for the d0xINFRA network
- Meme Factory - Curation functions, community functions, will be one of the first district registries, and will decentralize a crypto-collectible model that currently operates successfully with centralized parties.

## The Staking Interface
After the Aragon mainnet launch, we will deploy a staking interface that allows DNT holders to participate in open control over the districts through an Aragon governance layer for each of the markets that come online. When a district is created, an Aragon entity will also be created that people can interact with through the staking mechanism. After staking you will receive voting rights in that district.

## What is the District Creation Interface?
The creation interface can be described as the WordPress of dApps, the districts we’re launching are like wordpress templates, while auxiliary modules can be seen as WordPress plugins to extend functionality. This will all come together after the core d0xINFRA framework is online. This will dramatically lower the bar of entry for anyone wanting to remove central power structures from any marketplace they can dream up, even if they aren’t a developer.

## Governance
Aragon will be utilized as a governance layer and enable the ability to stake DNT to districts. It will also allow us to start building out district-specific governance functions. People will stake DNT in those varying governance models.

Some governance models that we will likely see:

- Time based staking
- Stake weighted
- Meritocracy and reputation hybrids
- Futarchy
- Liquid democracy or delegate style governance

When you stake DNT to a district you will be granted access to the Aragon entity’s voting rights. Considering the modular nature of Aragon, the benefit of staking will be different depending on the individual district.

Examples of things that governance participants could potentially control:

- Monetization
- District design
- Governance structure
- Bylaws
- Auxiliary modules utilized
- Utilization of fees and development funding
- Reputation systems
- Development roadmaps

## Conclusion
The end result will be a world where you can create a market that suits your needs, where market participants have the say as much as anyone else and no central power structure can dictate how the market works. We want anyone in the world to have access to the benefits that decentralization brings. The district0x network is yours and we can’t wait to see what you build.
