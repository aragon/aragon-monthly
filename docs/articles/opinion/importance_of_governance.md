Unstoppable Organizations!

That is Aragon's premise, but how on earth can you build such a thing?

You need a set of rules that everyone **must** follow in order to achieve any given organization goals. The must is the hard part, people do things for different reasons, and interests not always align,
so you need a system that can incentivize good behavior while punishing bad behavior.

Sounds familiar? This is what governments all around the world do. If you behave like a good citizen (by paying your
taxes, for example) you are "rewarded" by allowing you to get a job, get a government issued ID/drivers license, etc.

If you don't behave, you go to to jail, get fined and/or barred from certain communities, for example if you are a
doctor and kill someone because of negligence, you get expelled from the medic community and forbidden to exercise
your profession.

Enter governance.

To start, it may be good to define what governance is and then we can drill down into why it is important.

From Wikipedia "Governance is all of the processes of governing, whether undertaken by a government,
a market or a network, over a social system (family, tribe, formal or informal organization, a territory or across territories)
and whether through the laws, norms, power or language of an organized society.

It relates to "the processes of interaction and decision-making among the actors involved in a collective problem that lead to
the creation, reinforcement, or reproduction of social norms and institutions."

In lay terms, it could be described as the political processes that exist in between formal institutions."

That last line, pretty much sums it up.

If you don't have any governance, you have an anarchy, where there is no direction or common goals, causing confusion and disorder.

Hence, governance its an important topic that touches everyones lives in some way or another. With our current system, a government
is established, ground rules are set in the form of a constitution, and everyone in that same jurisdiction agrees to follow those ground
rules.

The current problem with this system is that lines are starting to blur. The Internet has enabled collaboration from individuals residing in
different countries and jurisdictions. These jurisdictions are not always compatible between each other, which leads to all sorts of issues
that affect productivity between them. If you think about it, those problems are expected since technology has evolved at a greater pace
than governance systems, which creates a gap between the two.

There are multiple projects trying to define new ways of Governance that can endure. [Decred](https://decred.org/), for example,
aims to solve the problems that Bitcoin has in it's governance by implementing a consensus voting model that empowers stakeholders
and allows for the seamless transition from one set of rules to another. This makes the project move at a faster pace
than Bitcoin since all stakeholders incentives are aligned with the development of the project itself.
Governance issues have plagued Bitcoin with multiple forks, community splits, and inability to move forward
on certain [Bitcoin Improvement Proposals](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips).

Aragon takes governance one step further, by not just allowing voting, but providing a platform to implement whole digital jurisdictions.
The value of this can't be underestimated, a digital jurisdiction enables all participants to know the rules and automatically (via smart
contracts) incentivizes good behavior by rewarding it, while punishing lechers or people trying to harm the organization. It also
completely erases the problem with incompatible jurisdictions, since you are now playing by the rules set by a group of people that have
similar goals, and we all know 2 heads (or a million) are better than 1!
