**Latest news from the Aragon Research & Development department, [Labs](https://blog.aragon.org/announcing-aragon-labs-a679693429ae/)** Our research efforts are on exploring how to realize the lofty ambition of becoming a decentralized, digital jurisdiction.  | **Introducing personal DAOs** A personal DAO is your own [Aragon DAO](https://wiki.aragon.org/tutorials/DAO_Workshop_Testnet_by_joselfgaray/#what-is-a-dao) that acts as your agent in the decentralized world. A personal DAO borrows [all the features you can expect](https://blog.aragon.org/aragon-core-v0-5-the-architect-release-327c7163b89c) from an Aragon DAO, but it isn't an organization comprised of multiple people.| **Aragon is taking action against censorship by moving away from Medium.** On the journey that we are on, making Web3.0, the decentralized web, a reality, there will be obstacles we need to overcome. Hurdles set by those clinging on to their power by any means necessary, even going as far as putting on blanket bans on all crypto projects. This effectively is censoring content by those trying to make the world a more free and open place to live. |

**She was astounded no one noticed her.** White skin, dressed in all black. Rash guard, board shorts, and a burn bag with a first aid kit, water shoes, and fins. Sweating from the anxiety, Kamaria knew that the trip she’d make in several hours could end in her throat being cut by smugglers, or police kidnapping her again. |
