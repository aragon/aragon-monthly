**APM stands for Aragon Package Manager.** The summary is that APM is a decentralized package manager. APM handles the upgradability of smart contracts as well as arbitrary data blobs. | **Welcome to the first Aragon community update!** We’ve had a lot going on in the foreground and background of the community since I first joined as Community Lead last year and I’m excited to share some of what we’ve been up to. | There’s a lot of confusion about blockchain governance. Many participants and potential participants inside and outside the blockchain space fail to effectively participate in blockchain governance. I hope that this situation will improve with more public understanding of the basics of blockchain governance, the possible governance outcomes, and how they can most effectively participate in blockchain governance. |

[<h2>ICOs are for fraud, DAOs are for function</h2>](articles/opinion/ICOs_For_Fraud-DAOs-For_Function.md) |

[_Opinion pieces_](#opinion-pieces) |
_Author [C.E. Davis III / @csggene3](https://github.com/csggene3)_ |
**The last two years have seen a precipitous rise and fall in the both the price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum amongst many new others branded as ICOs (or initial coin offerings) as well as a general awareness of their existence and the broader underlying ecosystems that accompany them.** Many this year are quite upset with their purchases from last year due to the steep drop off in associated prices. The perception is that software developers created simple tokens on the various issuing blockchains (like Ethereum, NEO, Cardano, Ethereum Classic, etc) that served little more purpose than to act as a form of quick and dirty security issuance, or "penny stock," with little oversight or regulation, and then cashed out large groups of shares for themselves, ostensibly to fund future software development of their projects, but truthfully or more likely to enrich themselves greatly with no intention or obligation for their promises to the public or their own investors to be kept. There are hundreds of similar projects like these with similar accusations against their progenitors and "developers," or dismissed as " honest failures due to diminished market conditions," yet these types of blatant excuses fall on the deaf ears of the thousands that lost out and the many other honest developers that knew better. |

Aragon is an open source, decentralized project fighting for the freedom to organize. We believe that decentralized organizations can solve the world's worst problems. **We’re looking for a Technical Writer to help us communicate the different moving parts of Aragon Core and Dev Tools to facilitate the development of the Ethereum community**. Our Technical Writer will be the bridge between Aragon engineers and external developers, as well as the reference to support the growth of the Ethereum community through better documentation. |
