 **Aragon Monthly is a community curated digital newspaper about DAOs and the Aragon ecosystem.** Decentralized Autonomous Organizations aka DAOs have for too long been a taboo few dared to speak out loud. The catastrophic failure of The DAO ensured that the topic of decentralized organizations was pushed into oblivion. Aragon Monthly is a community curated monthly digital newspaper about Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and the Aragon ecosystem. Aragon Monthly is created by the community, for the community. | **This is the first blog post in a series on decentralized governance systems, beginning with describing its most basic challenge and the necessary principles to overcome it.** Blockchain hype is at an all-time high and many people anticipate the first decentralized application to reach the market and gain mass adoption. The term DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) is no longer esoteric. And hundreds of like-minded teams are building decentralized collaborative social news, insurance and investment platforms, numerous collaboration spaces, and even a couple of decentralized autonomous space agencies.The common element still missing in the above examples is a proper decentralized governance system: an efficient and resilient engine for collective decision-making, at scale. The possibility of thousands, and millions, of people to make decisions together, quickly and wisely. | **Ethereum, the second-biggest cryptocurrency in the world, has great potential as a platform for autonomous applications.** It facilitates the transfer of its cryptocurrency, can support decentralised applications, and runs smart contracts. Smart contracts run on its blockchain and are the building blocks for ambitious projects, including games like CryptoKitties. To see what lies ahead for Ethereum, MyBroadband spoke to Ethereum developer Nick Johnson about the implications of decentralised organisations. |

**Written reviews of what the team members have been up to.** Team members produce a write-up of the most important things they have worked on since last Community Meeting, the problems they have found and what they plan to do in the next weeks (that can be a bit blurry, and that’s fine). These write-ups are published here as a blog post for the community to review. | **Where research meets development.** Ever since the early days of the Aragon project we’ve known that there will be obstacles that we’ll need to solve. Concepts that exist, but require research before we can begin implementing these ideas. But there’s no single solution in governance that works for each and every one. What might work well for a global aid organization likely doesn’t fit the needs of a neighbourhood lending ecosystem. | **If 2017 has been the year for ICOs, 2018 may be the year for the DAO return.** Organizations will, I believe, begin to implement simple DAO structures either for incentive systems or for non-centralized decision making and performance as they progressively realize how certain automations and decentralizations can benefit their current performance. Technically, a DAO is activated once its Smart Contract is deployed on the (ethereum, for this post) blockchain, and it has two main functionalities: a) to execute decisions via proposals and voting systems, and b) manage the token account (creation, transfer, burn) whilst defining the inner working of the structure itself. |
