Aragon needs the utmost care in this very important moment of its infancy. | **Voting is at the core of what we do at Aragon.** Even though there have been ample critiques to on-chain voting, it is still the most effective way for a group of diverse people to make collective decisions in a way that the decisions are legitimate and represent everyone's best interests. | **We're pleased to announce the full agenda** for the first AraCon, happening in Berlin on January 29-30, 2019.
