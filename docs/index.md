We owe corporations credit for much of the last century’s growth and advancement. The profit-motivated and legally-backed corporation operating in a free market is the latest and greatest innovation in how humans cooperate to create things of value. Great corporations constantly reallocate resources to solve problems, and in the process provide for employees and improve products for the public. Amazon brings packages to your front door in two days, Trader Joe’s sells healthy food at an affordable price, and Google organizes information for anyone to consume. | **Empowering unstoppable organizations through freedom of collaboration.** Understanding collaboration as the work of two or more people towards the achievement of a common goal, trade is one of the oldest forms of collaboration. The transfer of value between entities has for centuries motivated people to work together to fulfill a greater potential: the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. | **Written reviews of what the team members have been up to.** Team members will produce a write-up of the most important things they have worked on since last Community Meeting, the problems they have found and what they plan to do in the next weeks (that can be a bit blurry, and that’s fine). These write-ups will be published as a blog post for the community to review on Monday before Friday’s meeting. |

Abraham Lincoln famously said that “government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth,” but looking around these days, you would be forgiven if you thought representative democracy had already been buried alongside Washington, Jefferson, and Roosevelt. Confidence in Congress remains pitifully low, driven by perceived low ethical standards and an increasing awareness that politics is bought by the highest bidder. | **An incredible weekend of building and bonding with the Denver community.** This past weekend several members of the Aragon team, including Jorge, Luke, Oliver, and myself (John), attended ETHDenver in Colorado, USA. ETHDenver is an Ethereum community event featuring a hackathon and workshops. As we shared previously on the blog, Aragon helped sponsor the event this year and provided bounties for Best App/Integration and Best Proposal. What followed was a whirlwind weekend of hacking, mentoring, learning, and bonding. | An example of a list that could eventually become a TCR :) |
