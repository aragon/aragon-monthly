FIRST CONFERENCE FOR DISTRIBUTED GOVERNANCE, DEC. 7-9, ATHENS GREECE

Vision: Sustainable well-being empowered and enabled by distributed consensus technology.

THIS IS AN INHERENTLY INTERDISCIPLINARY event. THERE IS AN ACADEMIC GROUP THAT IS FORMED AMD WORKING TO EVOLVE THE paradigm of governance and human interaction therewith.

THE SPACE OF DiSTRIBUTED GOVERNANCE BY WAY OF DISTRIBUTED CONSENSUS AND DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECH is growing and is a grass roots horizontal experience for us earthlings to create.

SANDBOXING IN CRYPTO GOVERNANCE, we will mature our capacities for governance in ever more widespread and evolved manners.

Based on advanced cryptographic algorithms, a new digital technology consents trust relations without third party mediation; new machine learning algorithms make it possible for a computer program to beat the number one GO player of the world; the number of things and objects connected to the internet surpassed the human population. These are three major breakthroughs that occurred in the past ten years, and there are many more to come.  The implications of these technologies on the world economy and politics are tremendous: cryptocurrencies, e-voting, self-driving cars, quantum computing - we witness the eve of a technological revolution.

Find new ways to form consensus:
The institutions that govern our current economic and political systems were designed in the eighteenth century. These institutional foundations proved to be flexible enough to allow adjustments every time a new technology challenged the state of the art of human interaction. But now it seems to be different. Now decision making is not human specific any longer. What does this mean for the future of governance? The First Distributed Governance Conference is set to debate this question.
