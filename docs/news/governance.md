In this Article, we explore the benefits and drawbacks of this emerging decentralized technology and argue that its widespread deployment will lead to expansion of a new subset of law, which we term Lex Cryptographia: rules administered through self-executing smart contracts and decentralized (autonomous) organizations.. | **What is Liquid Democracy** In these series, we will research and publish our exploration of decentralized applications and Web 3.0 ecosystem. We plan to post small notes and articles on the subjects of decentralization, blockchain, economy, social and legal aspects, programming and future vision. | **Practical guidance for humming teams** This booklet is an extremely condensed summary of what we've learned about decentralised organising. If you're looking for more stories, conversations, training or consulting, check TheHum.org.|

**Schelling schemes and seeking consensus in a Decentralized Oracle Network** An oracle refers to the element that connects smart contracts with data from the outside world. Any data point outside the contracts’ blockchain is not accessible by design, so an oracle is needed to feed them information from external sources. | As we transition from a business paradigm of closed-door and centralized to a network paradigm of open and participatory, we’d benefit from recognizing that decision-making is an inherently political process. | How can online games as alternate realities be good simulations for how governance problems can be solved? What are issues of syncing a digital, measurable, and "perfect" world with unpredictable meat space? How can creators control behaviors and when should people be allowed to break poorly designed rules?  |

| **Introducing a decentralised autonomous gaming co-operative.** This paper describes the framework for the mechanics of the first Decentralised Autonomous Gaming Co-Operative (“Gaming Co-Op” or “Common”), an automated gaming organization designed to use incentive chains to grow autonomously and build long-term value for all participants. | On October 18th, we held an hour long conference call on “The Current State of Crypto Governance & Consensus” with four experts (Ari Paul — Managing Partner at BlockTower Capital, Kyle Samani— Managing Partner at Multicoin Capital, Stephanie Hurder, PhD — Founding Economist at Prysm Group, and Alex Evans — Research Associate at Placeholder). | Distributed governance is the specification of principles and methods which enable scalable coordination for forming consensus and to legitimate decisions. In such systems, all participants are treated equally without the presence of a central actor of hierarchy. They are scalable, so efficiency is not reduced but steady or increased by an increasing number of participants.

| **Within our eco-system of autonomous academies** Decision-making is a — if not the — core discipline of any organization. One of the reasons we are structured as autonomous academies is to enable decentralized decision-making. The goal is to move decision-making authority to the information and enable those that feel a sense of urgency to take initiative. This avoids decision bottlenecks and allows for decisions being made quickly where they are needed. | An update from Enigma on how our protocol can be used to implement “secret voting”, complete with a video walkthrough! | Decentralized governance is the field of protocols that coordinate large number of agents into a collective action, implemented with smart contracts on the blockchain. It is also the basis for decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). |

| At a minimum governance tokens need (1) a mechanism to ensure that only proposals which align with the stated intent of the organization are executed and (2) a mechanism that allows participants to safely exit en masse in response to contentious policies. | Core primitives are a set of concepts that are innately understood but cannot be expressed in simpler terms. | **By Jorge Izquierdo and Ramón Recuero.** We believe that blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies are, at the core, a new way of organizing and unlocking human potential.
