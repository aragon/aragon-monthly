|Token curated registries (TCRs) are an economically incentivized mechanism that promises to address a serious need in decentralized systems: to provide a reliable signal of quality on something you can’t directly observe. Some examples of questions that TCRs are intended to answer: Is John a good roommate? Is Guggenheim a good museum? Is Neptune Diner worth having lunch at?|Gnosis is proud to announce that it is entering into a partnership with DAOstack. Together, Gnosis and DAOstack will build autonomous, self-governing, reputation-based communities that empower millions of users on their platform. The founders of Gnosis and DAOstack respectively, have had a close relationship for many years consequently and will look to be united in their mission together.|A Graded Token-Curated Decision Protocol is a cryptoeconomic mechanism allowing an amorphous group of token holders to up- or downrank an object. Graded Token-Curated Registries implement fair ranking and reputation systems by alleviating the need for a centralized third party and by disincentivizing participants to provide fake or biased decisions.|

|This article introduces the Layered Token Curated Registry (LTCR), a new cryptographic building block. LTCRs are composed of layers of TCRs. They replace the rather harsh “you’re either in or out” approach of TCRs, with a step-by-step increase in rights and responsibilities as the actor adds more value and stake.|EIP0 Summit was a gathering which aimed to learn how to better govern Ethereum. Since last year, there have been difficulties in settling conflicts certain topics such as ASIC resistance and EIP999. Such issues revealed a greater need for better governance. This statement concludes the first EIP0 summit and projects future plans going forward.|As a human race we started taking governance seriously during the Renaissance period. We started to use our rationality to analyze our political systems, and developed a theoretical framework to think about governance systems, namely modern political science. Turns out it was pretty useful.|
