**Aragon Monthly is a community curated digital newspaper about DAOs and the Aragon ecosystem.** Decentralized Autonomous Organizations aka DAOs have for too long been a taboo few dared to speak out loud. The catastrophic failure of The DAO ensured that the topic of decentralized organizations was pushed into oblivion. Aragon Monthly is a community curated monthly digital newspaper about Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and the Aragon ecosystem. Aragon Monthly is created by the community, for the community. | **Written reviews of what the team members have been up to.** Team members will produce a write-up of the most important things they have worked on since last Community Meeting, the problems they have found and what they plan to do in the next weeks (that can be a bit blurry, and that’s fine). These write-ups will be published as a blog post for the community to review on Monday before Friday’s meeting. | **Where research meets development.** Ever since the early days of the Aragon project we’ve known that there will be obstacles that we’ll need to solve. Concepts that exist, but require research before we can begin implementing these ideas. But there’s no single solution in governance that works for each and every one. What might work well for a global aid organization likely doesn’t fit the needs of a neighbourhood lending ecosystem. |

Aragon is another one of those cryptocurrency projects intent on making the world a fairer place for everyone. More specifically, the team aims to build an infrastructure which lets anyone create value without borders or intermediaries. Additionally, they hope to democratize governance in the future, although that will not be easy. Decentralized organizations are an appealing business model, but making sure they work in the real world is something else entirely. | **Splitting the Foundation from the core devs, and kickstarting funding for other teams to work on Aragon.** In the tech world, startups usually capitalize by amassing Intellectual Property, data, and governance. They attempt to centralize all this to their own benefit. Most crypto projects that are pursuing decentralization can’t be categorized as startups. Crypto projects usually capitalize by creating a network/protocol/DApp that has a token which should become more valuable as the utility of its network/protocol/DApp grows. | **An incredible weekend of building and bonding with the Denver community.** This past weekend several members of the Aragon team, including Jorge, Luke, Oliver, and myself (John), attended ETHDenver in Colorado, USA. ETHDenver is an Ethereum community event featuring a hackathon and workshops. As we shared previously on the blog, Aragon helped sponsor the event this year and provided bounties for Best App/Integration and Best Proposal. What followed was a whirlwind weekend of hacking, mentoring, learning, and bonding. |

The transfer of value between entities has for centuries motivated people to work together to fulfill a greater potential: the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. |  |
