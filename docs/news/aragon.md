**The new operating system for protocols and DApps.** aragonOS is smart contract development framework with a very strong focus on governance and upgradeability. This architecture can be used by any complex DApp or protocol and it allows extendability with the ability to plug in any Aragon governance module. It was originally designed to build modular DAOs, but we ended up abstracting it more and more to the point where it would be useful as the fundamental building block of any decentralized project. |

**A grants program to support the development of the ecosystems.** To help support the ecosystem flourish, we are introducing, together with Placeholder — lead by Joel Monegro and Chris Burniske — a grants program called Aragon Nest. The team at Placeholder has years of experience in evaluating crypto projects and teams, and we are very proud to have their expertise onboard. The goal of the program is to attract talent to research and build the necessary tooling for developing solutions around Aragon and Ethereum. | **Written reviews of what the team members have been up to.** Team members will produce a write-up of the most important things they have worked on since last Community Meeting, the problems they have found and what they plan to do in the next weeks (that can be a bit blurry, and that’s fine). These write-ups will be published as a blog post for the community to review on Monday before Friday’s meeting. | **Progress of development from the last quarter of 2017.** In the last quarter of 2017 we were heads down developing everything for the version 0.5 release of the Aragon Core app. Lots of progress was made, first audit of the smart contracts was conducted with good results and we’re on track to get the testnet release out really soon™. It has been an incredible quarter of building, in which we have laid down the foundation for everything that is to come in 2018. Brett and Pierre joined the development team, who together with Olivier are an amazing founding technical team. |
