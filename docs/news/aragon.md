**Epicenter Episode #236** Aragon Founder Luis Cuende joined us to discuss their work on building tools for decentralized governance. We covered the origins of his deep drive, why this is a crucial fight for humanity and the tools that Aragon has built. | **Building upgradeable organizations on the blockchain** We begin with an overview of Aragon's vision for human organization, our recent 0.5 release, and what’s in store for the journey ahead. We’ll then dive into each component of our fully decentralized application stack, exploring the limits of smart contract and dapp development. | **Join us in building your own customized DAO on Ethereum** We are excited to invite our community to participate in Building DAOs, an educational video series that will feature the Aragon One developer team working side-by-side with community members and their teams to configure their smart contracts and build their DAOs. |
