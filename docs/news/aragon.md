| **A recap of what has been going on with Aragon during Q3 2018.** As per our Transparency Model, we do quarterly Transparency Reports of our use of funds and about the overall progress of the project. |  We are happy to introduce updates from these six amazing teams working on the Aragon and Ethereum ecosystems! As more teams get grants from the Nest program, also the amount of goals achieved increases. We are preparing for this by giving the teams their own voice here in the Aragon Project blog. | The world is changing at a rapid pace. Gone are the days where you could work 30 years at a company, then get a fancy watch and a golden handshake into retirement. The industrial revolution of the early 1800’s brought more people out of the country and into factories and workshops, attracted by better pay.

| **A refinement to our smart contract framework** Enhanced capabilities, reviewed by two independent audits, and depended upon by more than 100 DAOs on the Ethereum Mainnet.| **A new cycle for the Aragon Association with Stefano Bernardi as its Executive Director.** This is the first time in history that a project decentralizes itself. Aragon needs the utmost care in this very important moment of its infancy. | Voting is at the core of what we do at Aragon. Even though there have been ample critiques to on-chain voting, it is still the most effective way for a group of diverse people to make collective decisions in a way that the decisions are legitimate and represent everyone's best interests. |
