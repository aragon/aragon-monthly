 **Halfway Through Our First Milestone** We’ve been working hard on the [Datastore](https://github.com/espresso-org/aragon-datastore) and [Drive App](https://github.com/espresso-org/aragon-drive-app) for the last four weeks and since our first sprint just ended a couple days ago, we thought it would be a good time to post our first Espresso Team update!

And right now, we are reaching that goal of being a part of the astonishing and inspiring ETHBerlin hackathon. |
