In my last article, I’ve discussed some of the most common types of blockchain tokens and the disadvantages of making everything a utility token. A critique is not worth much without offering a solution, so in this article I’ll focus on a legacy inspired company governance on the blockchain. How do you ensure both upgradeability and stability. In other words, how do you make sure that people who are using your contract have trust that the entire system they’ve put their livelihoods in won’t fall under their feet and simultaneously ensure that the contract is flexible enough to adapt to changing circumstances? |

**Blockchain Is a Decentralized Governance System.** Blockchain hype is at an all-time high and many people anticipate the first decentralized application to reach the market and gain mass adoption. The term DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) is no longer esoteric. And hundreds of like-minded teams are building decentralized collaborative social news, insurance and investment platforms, numerous collaboration spaces, and even a couple of decentralized autonomous space agencies. | Since the “hack” of The DAO, this organizational structure has not been much used, I believe partially because of the reputational damage it caused, and partially due to its intrinsic complexity, especially for those who are not familiar with decentralized governance and/or blockchain. Nevertheless, if 2017 has been the year for ICOs, 2018 may be the year for the DAO return. |  |

**Decentralization is what many of us claim to love about blockchain.** The idea that our information is not controlled by a centralized server. The idea that a public ledger can be safely maintained without a central entity. The idea that something of value can cross boarders digitally and in only a matter of second or minutes. Blockchain is decentralized already, but what about the teams.. |

**Collaboration is defined in the dictionary as the situation of two or more people working together to create or achieve the same thing.** It’s a simple yet powerful concept that we will explore in this first piece of the series, touching on how the evolution of communication has shaped its form and how it then evolved to advance pretty much any human activity. |

**Democracies are typically seen as governments which call upon the governed to make the major decisions of government:** who shall lead, what policies to follow, what laws to enact. In all these matters democracies call upon ordinary citizens to make complex decisions with eventful consequences.  |
