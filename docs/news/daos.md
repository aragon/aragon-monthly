_In which I argue that “tightly coupled” on-chain voting is overrated, the status quo of “informal governance” as practiced by Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Zcash and similar systems is much less bad than commonly thought, that people who think that the purpose of blockchains is to completely expunge soft mushy human intuitions and feelings in favor of completely algorithmic governance (emphasis on “completely”) are absolutely crazy, and loosely coupled voting as done by Carbonvotes and similar systems is underrated, as well as describe what framework should be used when thinking about blockchain governance in the first place._ |

**Vitalik Buterin posts a new idea about DAICOs.** The idea is as follows. A DAICO contract is published by a single development team that wishes to raise funds for a project. The DAICO contract starts off in “contribution mode”, specifying a mechanism by which anyone can contribute ETH to the contract, and get tokens in exchange. This could be a capped sale, an uncapped sale, a dutch auction, an interactive coin offering, a KYC’d sale with dynamic per-person caps, or whatever other mechanism the team chooses. Once the contribution period ends, the ability to contribute ETH stops, and the initial token balances are set; from there on the tokens can become tradeable. | | |

**P2P Models is a €1.5M 5-year ERC research project to build decentralized, democratic, and sustainable Collaborative Economy organizations.** The Collaborative Economy is rapidly expanding, but it is dominated by centralized web platforms which hold user data and concentrate all decision-making power and profits. The idea of the P2P Models project is to tackle these issues, replacing the centralized web platform with DAOs on the blockchain, so we reduce the difference of power between the "infrastructure owner" and the user community. | We will provide "lego" building blocks, for easily building DAOs focused on collaboration, from commons-based peer production to sharing economy. We will also provide lego building blocks for series of governance and economic models, prioritizing democratic and redistribution approaches, and allowing others to build their own. | From P2PModels we'll be contributing to the blockchain space, from a commons-oriented approach rather than with a focus on Finance. We plan to explore reusing/contributing to awesome free/open source projects like Aragon, district0x, OpenZeppelin, and FairCoop. We are planning to publish several open positions in the following weeks. Stay tuned! |
