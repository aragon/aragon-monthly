In this Article, we explore the benefits and drawbacks of this emerging decentralized technology and argue that its widespread deployment will lead to expansion of a new subset of law, which we term Lex Cryptographia: rules administered through self-executing smart contracts and decentralized (autonomous) organizations.. | **What is Liquid Democracy** In these series, we will research and publish our exploration of decentralized applications and Web 3.0 ecosystem. We plan to post small notes and articles on the subjects of decentralization, blockchain, economy, social and legal aspects, programming and future vision. | **Practical guidance for humming teams** This booklet is an extremely condensed summary of what we've learned about decentralised organising.

**Schelling schemes and seeking consensus in a Decentralized Oracle Network** An oracle refers to the element that connects smart contracts with data from the outside world. Any data point outside the contracts’ blockchain is not accessible by design, so an oracle is needed to feed them information from external sources. | As we transition from a business paradigm of closed-door and centralized to a network paradigm of open and participatory, we’d benefit from recognizing that decision-making is an inherently political process. | How can online games as alternate realities be good simulations for how governance problems can be solved? What are issues of syncing a digital, measurable, and "perfect" world with unpredictable meat space? How can creators control behaviors and when should people be allowed to break poorly designed rules?  |

| Distributed governance is the specification of principles and methods which enable scalable coordination for forming consensus and to legitimate decisions. In such systems, all participants are treated equally without the presence of a central actor of hierarchy. They are scalable, so efficiency is not reduced but steady or increased by an increasing number of participants. | **Theodor Beutel** Exploring the frontiers of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations. | **Within our eco-system of autonomous academies** Decision-making is a — if not the — core discipline of any organization. One of the reasons we are structured as autonomous academies is to enable decentralized decision-making. The goal is to move decision-making authority to the information and enable those that feel a sense of urgency to take initiative. This avoids decision bottlenecks and allows for decisions being made quickly where they are needed.

| At a minimum governance tokens need (1) a mechanism to ensure that only proposals which align with the stated intent of the organization are executed and (2) a mechanism that allows participants to safely exit en masse in response to contentious policies. | Core primitives are a set of concepts that are innately understood but cannot be expressed in simpler terms. | **A recap of what has been going on with Aragon during Q3 2018.** As per our Transparency Model, we do quarterly Transparency Reports of our use of funds and about the overall progress of the project.

| **LeapDAO’s Friendly Frankenstein** Ideally, governance involves both public and private spheres to maintain adaptability and transparency. DAOs are great for transparency, but not so much for adaptability. Holacracy is great for adaptability, but not so much for transparency. LeapDAO thinks a combination of the two might be the answer. | We are happy to introduce updates from these six amazing teams working on the Aragon and Ethereum ecosystems! As more teams get grants from the Nest program, also the amount of goals achieved increases. We are preparing for this by giving the teams their own voice here in the Aragon Project blog. | The world is changing at a rapid pace. Gone are the days where you could work 30 years at a company, then get a fancy watch and a golden handshake into retirement. The industrial revolution of the early 1800’s brought more people out of the country and into factories and workshops, attracted by better pay.
