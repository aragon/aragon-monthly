**Aragon Monthly is a community curated digital newspaper about DAOs and the Aragon ecosystem.** Decentralized Autonomous Organizations aka DAOs have for too long been a taboo few dared to speak out loud. The catastrophic failure of The DAO ensured that the topic of decentralized organizations was pushed into oblivion. Aragon Monthly is a community curated monthly digital newspaper about Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and the Aragon ecosystem. Aragon Monthly is created by the community, for the community. | **Written reviews of what the team members have been up to.** Team members will produce a write-up of the most important things they have worked on since last Community Meeting, the problems they have found and what they plan to do in the next weeks (that can be a bit blurry, and that’s fine). These write-ups will be published as a blog post for the community to review on Monday before Friday’s meeting. | **Blockchain Is a Decentralized Governance System.** Blockchain hype is at an all-time high and many people anticipate the first decentralized application to reach the market and gain mass adoption. The term DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) is no longer esoteric. And hundreds of like-minded teams are building decentralized collaborative social news, insurance and investment platforms, numerous collaboration spaces, and even a couple of decentralized autonomous space agencies. |

**Ethereum, the second-biggest cryptocurrency in the world, has great potential as a platform for autonomous applications.** It facilitates the transfer of its cryptocurrency, can support decentralised applications, and runs smart contracts. Smart contracts run on its blockchain and are the building blocks for ambitious projects, including games like CryptoKitties. To see what lies ahead for Ethereum, MyBroadband spoke to Ethereum developer Nick Johnson about the implications of decentralised organisations. | Since the “hack” of The DAO, this organizational structure has not been much used, I believe partially because of the reputational damage it caused, and partially due to its intrinsic complexity, especially for those who are not familiar with decentralized governance and/or blockchain. Nevertheless, if 2017 has been the year for ICOs, 2018 may be the year for the DAO return. | **What are Bonding Curves?** This is a technical primer on how to make your own bonding curves, followed by a discussion about the opportunities and risks involved. If you’re not interested in the tech, skip to the end for some general insights. If you just want some code samples in solidity, the reference github repo is [here](https://github.com/relevant-community/contracts/tree/bondingCurves/contracts) |

**Where research meets development.** Ever since the early days of the Aragon project we’ve known that there will be obstacles that we’ll need to solve. Concepts that exist, but require research before we can begin implementing these ideas. But there’s no single solution in governance that works for each and every one. What might work well for a global aid organization likely doesn’t fit the needs of a neighbourhood lending ecosystem. | This post is a continuation of part 1, which provided an introduction to blockchain race conditions, front-running, the 0x protocol specification and presented two ways that 0x protocol may be used to implement a decentralized exchange that eliminates front-running and trade collisions by setting the 0x order schema’s taker parameter to an externally owned account (EOA). | Space Decentral hopes to leverage some of the current development work under way in the Ethereum community to produce an open-source toolbox to collaboratively design space missions. "Space technology and Earth technology go hand in hand — we need to utilize systems thinking to solve problems in parallel,” said Yalda Mousavinia, Space Decentral co-founder, referring to blockchain technology and distributed engineering. |

Aragon is another one of those cryptocurrency projects intent on making the world a fairer place for everyone. More specifically, the team aims to build an infrastructure which lets anyone create value without borders or intermediaries. Additionally, they hope to democratize governance in the future, although that will not be easy. Decentralized organizations are an appealing business model, but making sure they work in the real world is something else entirely. | **Splitting the Foundation from the core devs, and kickstarting funding for other teams to work on Aragon.** In the tech world, startups usually capitalize by amassing Intellectual Property, data, and governance. They attempt to centralize all this to their own benefit. Most crypto projects that are pursuing decentralization can’t be categorized as startups. Crypto projects usually capitalize by creating a network/protocol/DApp that has a token which should become more valuable as the utility of its network/protocol/DApp grows. | |
