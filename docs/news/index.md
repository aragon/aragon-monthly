**An Operational Framework for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations.** A few thought leaders and visionaries explained the theory and vision of DAOs/DACs, but missing from the literature are real experiences and a deeper dive into the realities of operating a DAO. Certainly not all DAOs will be born by following a cookbook. And there will be variations and shades of purity in DAO principles, for practical purposes. | **The flaws of shareholder voting and blockchain governance.** This post mainly addresses blockchain governance. It was written mainly with blockchains in mind rather than blockchain based protocols. However, points made can be applied to both. | **This concept paper describes how a global DAO may be implemented in a fully regulated manner.** A Decentralized Autonomous Organisation or a DAO is one of the holy grails of blockchain technology. It promises to unlock the full potential of Blockchain in a real world scenario. Here is an excerpt from the Ethereum whitepaper itself. |

**Patents, open source and beyond.** tl;dr: What’s behind any digital token, asset, or contract is a package of rights — how we assign and interpret these rights is at the heart of blockchain governance | **Our favorite stories covering the future of work and decentralized governance.** Uber grapples with employment rights. Holacracies approach a union with DAOs. A collective corporation sets an example. And IBM’s Red Hat acquisition hints at something bigger. | **On Governance: Coordination, Layers, and Structural Integrity.** “Governance” has recently been echoed quite frequently, as more individuals realize how large a role process plays in upgrading ‘decentralized’ protocols. Vlad Zamfir, for example, has written plenty of primers over time on governance and what it means to stakeholders (encapsulating all users) in the control, hopefully, of a public good. |

**Intersections create friction, and that's where innovation happens.** One intersection that we've been taking a close look at this year is between the human and technological side of participatory governance. While technology may have some answers, we think that the importance and complexity of making the human and 'cultural' side work, is often underestimated. | **Decentralized Law Enforcement.** A lot of thought has been put into how to incentivize the jurors to take the time to properly judge a given case, so that the coherent ruling is also likely to be the honest ruling. Indeed, the Kleros appeal system is built in such a way that jurors should remain incentivized to put in this time even as there is the possibility that appeals pull in more and more jurors. | **On transparency, governance, and the challenge of keeping Ethereum alive.** A political storm is brewing in Ethereum over the question of transparency. How are decisions about the protocol made? Who is responsible for those decisions? What obligation do those decision makers have to be transparent about the processes that go into that decision making, and how much of that process needs to be transparent? |

**Thinking about contents as DAOs.** The DAO landscape is going through a cambrian-explosion era. Most of the time, we think of DAOs as organizations such as companies, associations, cooperatives but less frequently as contents such as video-games, books, software or songs. | **Resources for decentralised organising.** I recently asked on Twitter and on a mailing list for examples of decentralised organisations that have a public, transparent, well-documented handbook that explains how they work (e.g. decision making, roles, communications tools, etc). The response was overwhelming so I’ve digested it into this page. | **Aragon Wants You! (To Help Decentralize Its Governance Process)** Aragon wants to offer a neutral, decentralized digital jurisdiction for DAOs. As it stands, it appears plenty of folks are hungry to build organizations on Aragon’s stack, but there is less interest in participating in the governance of the network. If decentralization is to be achieved, that needs to change. |

**The progress of development from the fourth quarter of 2018.** The fourth quarter of 2018, spanning the months of October to December, was all about shipping, iterating, and then more shipping. The period also coincided with many breakthroughs on our research, from scalable on-chain voting to a crystallization of the first version of the Aragon Network. | **When is decentralised Governance feasible? When is it inevitable?** Invisible rules govern our everyday lives. You don’t walk on the road because the consequences (being run over by a car) don’t outweigh the benefits (more room for pedestrians). ‘Bad’ behaviour is disincentivised (fines, horrible death), even as compliant ‘good’ behaviour might be moderately annoying (trailing people competing for slowest walking pace). |
