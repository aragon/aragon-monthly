It will involve decentralizing Aragon’s development, minimising the Foundation's role, decoupling the project from the foundational team and to level the playground for other teams to jump into the core development of the project.|EIP0 Summit was a gathering which aimed to learn how to better govern Ethereum. Since last year, there have been difficulties in settling conflicts certain topics such as ASIC resistance and EIP999. Such issues revealed a greater need for better governance.
