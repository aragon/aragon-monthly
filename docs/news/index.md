**Aragon is taking action against censorship by moving away from Medium.** On the journey that we are on, making Web3.0, the decentralized web, a reality, there will be obstacles we need to overcome. Hurdles set by those clinging on to their power by any means necessary, even going as far as putting on blanket bans on all crypto projects.

 **Halfway Through Our First Milestone** We’ve been working hard on the [Datastore](https://github.com/espresso-org/aragon-datastore) and [Drive App](https://github.com/espresso-org/aragon-drive-app) for the last four weeks and since our first sprint just ended a couple days ago, we thought it would be a good time to post our first Espresso Team update! For some of you who are not familiar with our projects, you can learn more about us and the Aragon Nest program [here](https://blog.aragon.org/aragon-nest-second-round-of-grants/). So without further ado, here is what we have been up to during the month of August. | **I've been thinking a lot about what motivates those of us BUIDLing blockchain products.** Three types of motivation keep emerging in my consciousness and daily experience. Each type has its own attractions and difficulties. This post will explain my perspective on the three. | **Hey, hey, heeey! This is Aragon and we are coming to ETHBerlin, Berlin!** We are so excited, so happy, really so thrilled to be [Tier 5 – The Carlos Matos sponsor](https://ethberlin.com/sponsors/) of the hackathon. Our [mentors](https://medium.com/ethberlin/so-you-think-you-can-mentor-280648923a0f) are coming, and they are coming in waves! Let me tell you, that we started 92 days ago with only one goal in mind. And right now, we are reaching that goal of being a part of the astonishing and inspiring ETHBerlin hackathon. |
