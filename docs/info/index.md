# Project info

# [Aragon Monthly](https://monthly.aragon.one/)

### Aragon Monthly is **a community-curated monthly digital newspaper** about Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and the [Aragon](https://aragon.one) ecosystem

> **Content curation is the process of gathering information relevant to a particular topic or area of interest.**

Aragon Monthly is **created by the community, for the community**.

**Anyone can contribute** by [creating or requesting new content](#how-can-i-contribute) regarding Decentralized Autonomous Organizations or about anything related to the Aragon ecosystem.
___
## How does this work?

- **Community members**, [**Contributors**](../contributors/contributors.md) and [**Editors**](../contributors/editors.md) create [Issues](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-monthly/issues) for [News](../news/index.md), [Articles](../articles/index.md) and [Classifieds](../classifieds/index.md)
    - _These [Issues](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-monthly/issues) are **requests for new content** to the upcoming newspaper issue_
    ___
- [Issues](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-monthly/issues) that get "_upvoted_" by the community will have **a [`bounty` label](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-monthly/labels/bounty) added** and that **`bounty`** will be **funded to incentivise fulfillment of that request**
    - _Editors can also add the `bounty` label to any [Issue](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-monthly/issues) they consider to be interesting content_
        - _The person who created the [Issue](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-monthly/issues) may also request the [`bounty` label](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-monthly/labels/bounty) to be added if they wish to fund that Issue themselves_
    - _Once a bounty label has been added, **anyone** can send funds (ETH or ERC20 tokens) to the smart contract and help fund that bounty_
    ___
- **Anyone can contribute** to creating the requested content on [Issues](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-monthly/issues) **by creating a new [Pull Request](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-monthly/pulls)** that fills the request
    - _By creating a new [Pull Request](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-monthly/pulls) that `Closes issue #X`, **anyone is free to claim the bounty on that Issue**_
        - _These will be reviewed on a first-come first-served basis_
    - _**Editors** are community members that frequently contribute high quality content and **have priority over other contributors**. They can **assign themselves** to [Issues](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-monthly/issues) in order to signal their intent to fulfill that particular Issue_
    ___
- At the end of the month, [Pull Requests](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-monthly/pulls) are frozen and any open [Issues](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-monthly/issues) are cleaned
    - Editors will evaluate open [Issues](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-monthly/issues) to see if they think it should be carried over to the next newspaper issue and close all remaining ones
    - Reviewers and Editors will review all open [Pull Requests](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-monthly/pulls) and either merge or close those accordingly
    - The [Editor-in-chief](#staff-contributors) makes sure that all completed [Pull Requests](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-monthly/pulls) are merged, compiles the Front Page and ensures that everything is working fine, publishes the Monthly newspaper issue to [https://monthly.aragon.one/](https://monthly.aragon.one/) and sends out the Aragon Monthly Newsletter
